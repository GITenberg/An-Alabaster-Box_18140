<blockquote>......There came a woman, having an alabaster box of ointment, very precious; and she broke the box.....</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Chapter I</h4>

<p>&ldquo;We,&rdquo; said Mrs. Solomon Black with weighty emphasis,
&ldquo;are going to get up a church fair and raise that money, and we
are going to pay your salary. We can't stand it another minute. We
had better run in debt to the butcher and baker than to the
Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wesley Elliot regarded her gloomily. &ldquo;I never liked the idea
of church fairs very well,&rdquo; he returned hesitatingly. &ldquo;It
has always seemed to me like sheer beggary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Mrs. Solomon Black, &ldquo;we will
beg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Solomon Black was a woman who had always had her way. There
was not one line which denoted yielding in her large, still handsome
face, set about with very elaborate water-waves which she had
arranged so many years that her black hair needed scarcely any
attention. It would almost seem as if Mrs. Solomon Black had been
born with water waves.</p>

<p>She spoke firmly but she smiled, as his mother might have done, at
the young man, who had preached his innocent best in Brookville for
months without any emolument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don't you worry one mite about it,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;Church fairs may be begging, but they belong to the history of
the United States of America, and I miss my guess if there would have
been much preaching of the gospel in a good many places without them.
I guess it ain't any worse to hold church fairs in this country than
it is to have the outrageous goings on in the old country. I guess we
can cheat a little with mats and cakes and things and not stand any
more danger of hell-fire than all those men putting each other's eyes
out and killing everybody they can hit, and spending the money for
guns and awful exploding stuff that ought to go for the good of the
world. I ain't worried one mite about church fairs when the world is
where it is now. You just run right into your study, Mr. Elliot, and
finish your sermon; and there's a pan of hot doughnuts on the kitchen
table. You go through the kitchen and get some doughnuts. We had
breakfast early and you hadn't ought to work too hard on an empty
stomach. You run along. Don't you worry. All this is up to me and
Maria Dodge and Abby Daggett and a few others. You haven't got one
blessed thing to do with it. All you've got to do is to preach as
well as you can, and keep us from a free fight. Almost always there
is a fuss when women get up a fair. If you can preach the gospel so
we are all on speaking terms when it is finished, you will earn your
money twice over. Run along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wesley Elliot obeyed. He always obeyed, at least in the literal
sense, when Mrs. Solomon Black ordered him. There was about her a
fairly masterly maternity. She loved the young minister as firmly for
his own good as if he had been her son. She chuckled happily when she
heard him open the kitchen door. &ldquo;He'll light into those hot
doughnuts,&rdquo; she thought. She loved to pet the boy in the
man.</p>

<p>Wesley Elliot in his study upstairs&mdash;a makeshift of a
study&mdash;sat munching hot doughnuts and reflecting. He had only
about one-third of his sermon written and it was Saturday, but that
did not disturb him. He had a quick-moving mind. He sometimes
wondered whether it did not move too quickly. Wesley was not a
conceited man in one sense. He never had doubt of his power, but he
had grave doubts of the merits of his productions. However, today he
was glad of the high rate of speed of which he was capable, and did
not worry as much as he sometimes did about his landing at the exact
goal. He knew very well that he could finish his sermon, easily, eat
his doughnuts, and sit reflecting as long as he chose. He chose to do
so for a long time, although his reflections were not particularly
happy ones. When he had left the theological seminary a year ago, he
had had his life planned out so exactly that it did not seem possible
to him that the plans could fail. He had graduated at the head of his
class. He had had no doubt of a city church. One of the professors, a
rich man with much influence, had practically promised him one.
Wesley went home to his doting mother, and told her the news.
Wesley's mother believed in much more than the city church. She
believed her son to be capable of anything. &ldquo;I shall have a
large salary, mother,&rdquo; boasted Wesley, &ldquo;and you shall
have the best clothes money can buy, and the parsonage is sure to be
beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will your old mother look in fine feathers, in such a
beautiful home?&rdquo; asked Wesley's mother, but she asked as a
lovely, much-petted woman asks such a question. She had her little
conscious smile all ready for the rejoinder which she knew her son
would not fail to give. He was very proud of his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as far as that goes, I
wouldn't balk at a throne for you as queen dowager.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a silly boy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Elliot, but she stole
a glance at herself in an opposite mirror, and smiled complacently.
She did not look old enough to be the mother of her son. She was tall
and slender, and fair-haired, and she knew how to dress well on her
very small income. She was rosy, and carried herself with a sweet
serenity. People said Wesley would not need a wife as long as he had
such a mother. But he did not have her long. Only a month later she
died, and while the boy was still striving to play the r&ocirc;le of
hero in that calamity, there came news of another. His professor
friend had a son in the trenches. The son had been wounded, and the
father had obeyed a hurried call, found his son dead, and himself
died of the shock on the return voyage. Wesley, mourning the man who
had been his stanch friend, was guiltily conscious of his thwarted
ambition. &ldquo;There goes my city church,&rdquo; he thought, and
flung the thought back at himself in anger at his own self-seeking.
He was forced into accepting the first opportunity which offered. His
mother had an annuity, which he himself had insisted upon for her
greater comfort. When she died, the son was nearly penniless, except
for the house, which was old and in need of repair.</p>

<p>He rented that as soon as he received his call to Brookville,
after preaching a humiliating number of trial sermons in other
places. Wesley was of the lowly in mind, with no expectation of
inheriting the earth, when he came to rest in the little village and
began boarding at Mrs. Solomon Black's. But even then he did not know
how bad the situation really was. He had rented his house, and the
rent kept him in decent clothes, but not enough books. He had only a
little shelf filled with the absolutely necessary volumes, most of
them relics of his college course. He did not know that there was
small chance of even his meager salary being paid until June, and he
had been ordained in February. He had wondered why nobody said
anything about his reimbursement. He had refrained from mentioning
it, to even his deacons.</p>

<p>Mrs. Solomon Black had revealed the state of affairs, that
morning. &ldquo;You may as well know,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;There
ain't a cent to pay you, and I said when you came that if we couldn't
pay for gospel privileges we should all take to our closets and pray
like Sam Hill, and no charge; but they wouldn't listen to me, though
I spoke right out in conference meeting and it's seldom a woman does
that, you know. Folks in this place have been hanging onto the ragged
edge of nothing so long they don't seem to sense it. They thought the
money for your salary was going to be brought down from heaven by a
dove or something, when all the time, those wicked flying things are
going round on the other side of the earth, and there don't seem as
if there could be a dove left. Well, now that the time's come when
you ought to be paid, if there's any decency left in the place, they
comes to me and says, &lsquo;Oh, Mrs. Black, what shall we do?&rsquo;
 I said, &lsquo;Why didn't you listen when I spoke out in meeting
about our not being able to afford luxuries like gospel
preaching?&rsquo; and they said they thought matters would have
improved by this time. Improved! How, I'd like to know? The whole
world is sliding down hill faster and faster every minute, and folks
in Brookville think matters are going to improve, when they are
sliding right along with the Emperor of Germany and the King of
England, and all the rest of the big bugs. I can't figure it out, but
in some queer, outlandish way that war over there has made it so
folks in Brookville can't pay their minister's salary. They didn't
have much before, but such a one got a little for selling eggs and
chickens that has had to eat them, and the street railway failed, and
the chair factory, that was the only industry left here, failed, and
folks that had a little to pay had to eat their payings. And here you
are, and it's got to be the fair. Seems queer the war in Europe
should be the means of getting up a fair in Brookville, but I guess
it'll get up more'n that before they're through fighting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this had been the preliminary to the speech which sent Wesley
forth for doughnuts, then to his study, ostensibly to finish his
lovely sermon, but in reality to think thoughts which made his young
forehead, of almost boyhood, frown, and his pleasant mouth droop,
then inexplicably smooth and smile. It was a day which no man in the
flush of youth could resist. That June day fairly rioted in through
the open windows. Mrs. Black's muslin curtains danced in the June
breeze like filmy-skirted nymphs. Wesley, whose imagination was
active, seemed to see forced upon his eager, yet reluctant, eyes,
radiant maidens, flinging their white draperies about, dancing a
dance of the innocence which preludes the knowledge of love. Sweet
scents came in through the windows, almond scents, honey scents, rose
scents, all mingled into an ineffable bouquet of youth and the quest
of youth.</p>

<p>Wesley rose stealthily; he got his hat; he tiptoed across the
room. Heavens! how thankful he was for access to the back stairs.
Mrs. Black was sweeping the parlor, and the rear of the house was
deserted. Down the precipitous back stairs crept the young minister,
listening to the sound of the broom on Mrs. Black's parlor carpet. As
long as that regular swish continued he was safe. Through the kitchen
he passed, feeling guilty as he smelled new peas cooking for his
delectation on Mrs. Black's stove. Out of the kitchen door, under the
green hood of the back porch, and he was afield, and the day had him
fast. He did not belong any more to his aspirations, to his high and
noble ambitions, to his steadfast purpose in life. He belonged to the
spring of the planet from which his animal life had sprung. Young
Wesley Elliot became one with June, with eternal youth, with joy
which escapes care, with the present which has nothing to do with the
past or the future, with that day sufficient unto itself, that day
dangerous for those whose feet are held fast by the toils of the
years.</p>

<p>Wesley sped across a field which was like a field of green glory.
He saw a hollow like a nest, blue with violets, and all his thoughts
leaped with irresponsive joy. He crossed a brook on rocky stones, as
if he were crossing a song. A bird sang in perfect tune with his
mood. He was bound for a place which had a romantic interest for him:
the unoccupied parsonage, which he could occupy were he supplied with
a salary and had a wife. He loved to sit on the back veranda and
dream. Sometimes he had company. Brookville was a hot little village,
with a long line of hills cutting off the south wind, but on that
back veranda of the old parsonage there was always a breeze.
Sometimes it seemed mysterious to Wesley, that breeze. It never
failed in the hottest days. Now that the parsonage was vacant, women
often came there with their needlework of an afternoon, and sat and
sewed and chatted. Wesley knew of the custom, and had made them
welcome. But sometimes of a morning a girl came. Wesley wondered if
she would be there that morning. After he had left the field, he
plunged knee-deep through the weedage of his predecessor's garden,
and heart-deep into luxuriant ranks of dewy vegetables which he, in
the intervals of his mental labors, should raise for his own table.
Wesley had an inherent love of gardening which he had never been in a
position to gratify. Wesley was, in fancy, eating his own green peas
and squashes and things when he came in sight of the back veranda. It
was vacant, and his fancy sank in his mind like a plummet of lead.
However, he approached, and the breeze of blessing greeted him like a
presence.</p>

<p>The parsonage was a gray old shadow of a building. Its walls were
stained with past rains, the roof showed depressions, the veranda
steps were unsteady, in fact one was gone. Wesley mounted and seated
himself in one of the gnarled old rustic chairs which defied weather.
From where he sat he could see a pink and white plumage of blossoms
over an orchard; even the weedy garden showed lovely lights under the
triumphant June sun. Butterflies skimmed over it, always in pairs,
now and then a dew-light like a jewel gleamed out, and gave a
delectable thrill of mystery. Wesley wished the girl were there. Then
she came. He saw a flutter of blue in the garden, then a face like a
rose overtopped the weeds. The sunlight glanced from a dark head,
giving it high-lights of gold.</p>

<p>The girl approached. When she saw the minister, she started, but
not as if with surprise; rather as if she had made ready to start.
She stood at the foot of the steps, glowing with blushes, but still
not confused. She smiled with friendly confidence. She was very
pretty and she wore a delicious gown, if one were not a woman, to
observe the lack of fashion and the faded streaks, and she carried a
little silk work-bag.</p>

<p>Wesley rose. He also blushed, and looked more confused than the
girl. &ldquo;Good morning, Miss Dodge,&rdquo; he said. His hands
twitched a little.</p>

<p>Fanny Dodge noted his confusion quite calmly. &ldquo;Are you
busy?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are laughing at me, Miss Dodge. What on earth am I busy
about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Of course I have eyes, and
I can see that you are not writing; but I can't see your mind, or
your thoughts. For all I know, they may be simply grinding out a
sermon, and today is Saturday. I don't want to break up the
meeting.&rdquo;  She laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on up here,&rdquo; said Wesley with camaraderie.
&ldquo;You know I am not doing a blessed thing. I can finish my
sermon in an hour after dinner. Come on up. The breeze is heavenly.
What have you got in that bag?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; stated Fanny Dodge, mounting the steps,
&ldquo;have my work in my bag. I am embroidering a center-piece which
is to be sold for at least twice its value&mdash;for I can't
embroider worth a cent&mdash;at the fair.&rdquo;  She sat down beside
him, and fished out of the bag a square of white linen and some
colored silks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Black has just told me about that fair,&rdquo; said
Wesley. &ldquo;Say, do you know, I loathe the idea of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? A fair is no end of fun. We always have
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beggary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. I might just as well put on some black glasses,
get a little dog with a string, and a basket, and done with
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl giggled. &ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;but your salary has to be paid, and folks have to be cajoled
into handing out the money.&rdquo;  Suddenly she looked troubled.
&ldquo;If there is any to hand,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to tell me something and be quite frank about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny shot a glance at him. Her lashes were long, and she could
look through them with liquid fire of dark eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said she. She threaded a needle with pink
silk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Brookville a very poor village?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny inserted her pink-threaded needle into the square of
linen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; she inquired with gravity, &ldquo;is the past
tense of bust?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am in earnest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I. But I know a minister is never supposed to know
about such a word as bust, even if he is bust two-thirds of is life.
I'll tell you. First Brookville was bust, now it's busted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wesley stared at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fact,&rdquo; said Fanny, calmly, starting a rose on the
linen in a career of bloom. &ldquo;First, years ago, when I was
nothing but a kid, Andrew Bolton&mdash;you have heard of Andrew
Bolton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard him mentioned. I have never understood why
everybody was so down on him, though he is serving a term in prison,
I believe. Nobody seems to like to explain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The reason for that is plain enough,&rdquo; stated Fanny.
&ldquo;Nobody likes to admit he's been made a fool of. The man who
takes the gold brick always tries to hide it if he can't blame it off
on his wife or sister or aunt. Andrew Bolton must have made perfectly
awful fools of everybody in Brookville. They must have thought of him
as a little tin god on wheels till he wrecked the bank and the silk
factory, and ran off with a lot of money belonging to his disciples,
and got caught by the hand of the law, and landed in State's Prison.
That's why they don't tell. Reckon my poor father, if he were alive,
wouldn't tell. I didn't have anything to do with it, so I am telling.
When Andrew Bolton embezzled the town went bust. Now the war in
Europe, through the grinding of wheels which I can't comprehend, has
bankrupted the street railway and the chair factory, and the town is
busted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, as you say, if there is no money, why a fair?&rdquo;
Wesley had paled a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied the girl, &ldquo;there is always the
hoarding instinct to be taken into account. There are still a lot of
stockings and feather beds and teapots in Brookville. We still have
faith that a fair can mine a little gold out of them for you. Of
course we don't know, but this is a Yankee village, and Yankees never
do spend the last cent. I admit you may get somebody's funeral
expenses out of the teapot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; groaned Wesley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; remarked the girl, &ldquo;is almost swearing.
I am surprised, and you a minister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is an awful state of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;Mrs. B. H. Slocum may come
over from Grenoble. She used to live here, and has never lost her
interest in Brookville. She is rich. She can buy a lot, and she is
very good-natured about being cheated for the gospel's sake. Then,
too, Brookville has never lost its guardian angels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I say. The faith of the people here in guardian angels
is a wonderful thing. Sometimes it seems to me as if all Brookville
considered itself under special guardianship, sort of a
hen-and-chicken arrangement, you know. Anyhow, they do go ahead and
undertake the craziest things, and come out somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Wesley Elliot soberly, &ldquo;that I
ought to resign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the girl paled, and bent closer over her work.
&ldquo;Resign!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, resign. I admit I haven't enough money to live without
a salary, though I would like to stay here forever.&rdquo;  Wesley
spoke with fervor, his eyes on the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you wouldn't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I most certainly would, but I can't run in debt,
and&mdash;I want to marry some day&mdash;like other young
men&mdash;and I must earn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl bent her head lower. &ldquo;Why don't you resign and go
away, and get&mdash;married, if you want to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bent over her. His lips touched her hair. &ldquo;You
know,&rdquo; he began&mdash;then came a voice like the legendary
sword which divides lovers for their best temporal and spiritual
good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dinner is ready and the peas are getting cold,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Solomon Black.</p>

<p>Then it happened that Wesley Elliot, although a man and a
clergyman, followed like a little boy the large woman with the
water-waves through the weedage of the pastoral garden, and the girl
sat weeping awhile from mixed emotions of anger and grief. Then she
took a little puff from her bag, powdered her nose, straightened her
hair and, also, went home, bag in hand, to her own noon dinner.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter II</h4>

<p>A church fair is one of the purely feminine functions which will
be the last to disappear when the balance between the sexes is more
evenly adjusted. It is almost a pity to assume that it will finally,
in the nature of things, disappear, for it is charming; it is
innocent with the innocence of very good, simple women; it is at the
same time subtle with that inimitable subtlety which only such women
can achieve. It is petty finance on such a moral height that even the
sufferers by its code must look up to it. Before even woman, showing
anything except a timid face of discovery at the sights of New York
under male escort, invaded Wall Street, the church fair was in full
tide, and the managers thereof might have put financiers to shame by
the cunning, if not magnitude, of their operations. Good Christian
women, mothers of families, would sell a tidy of no use except to
wear to a frayed edge the masculine nerves, and hand-painted plates
of such bad art that it verged on immorality, for prices so above all
reason, that a broker would have been taken aback. And it was all for
worthy objects, these pretty functions graced by girls and matrons in
their best attire, with the products of their little hands offered,
or even forced, upon the outsider who was held up for the ticket.
They gambled shamelessly to buy a new carpet for the church. There
was plain and brazen raffling for dreadful lamps and patent rockers
and dolls which did not look fit to be owned by nice little
girl-mothers, and all for the church organ, the minister's salary and
such like. Of this description was the church fair held in Brookville
to raise money to pay the Reverend Wesley Elliot. He came early, and
haunted the place like a morbid spirit. He was both angry and shamed
that such means must be employed to pay his just dues, but since it
had to be he could not absent himself.</p>

<p>There was no parlor in the church, and not long after the infamous
exit of Andrew Bolton the town hall had been destroyed by fire.
Therefore all such functions were held in a place which otherwise was
a source of sad humiliation to its owner: Mrs. Amos Whittle, the
deacon's wife's unfurnished best parlor. It was a very large room,
and poor Mrs. Whittle had always dreamed of a fine tapestry carpet,
furniture upholstered with plush, a piano, and lace curtains.</p>

<p>Her dreams had never been realized. The old tragedy of the little
village had cropped dreams, like a species of celestial foliage,
close to their roots. Poor Mrs. Whittle, although she did not realize
it, missed her dreams more than she would have missed the furniture
of that best parlor, had she ever possessed and lost it. She had come
to think of it as a room in one of the &ldquo;many mansions,&rdquo;
although she would have been horrified had she known that she did so.
She was one who kept her religion and her daily life chemically
differentiated. She endeavored to maintain her soul on a high level
of orthodoxy, while her large, flat feet trod her round of household
tasks. It was only when her best parlor, great empty room, was in
demand for some social function like the church fair, that she felt
her old dreams return and stimulate her as with some wine of
youth.</p>

<p>The room was very prettily decorated with blossoming boughs, and
Japanese lanterns, and set about with long tables covered with white,
which contained the articles for sale. In the center of the room was
the flower-booth, and that was lovely. It was a circle of green, with
oval openings to frame young girl-faces, and on the circular shelf
were heaped flowers in brilliant masses. At seven o'clock the fair
was in full swing, as far as the wares and saleswomen were concerned.
At the flower-booth were four pretty girls: Fanny Dodge, Ellen Dix,
Joyce Fulsom and Ethel Mixter. Each stood looking out of her frame of
green, and beamed with happiness in her own youth and beauty. They
did not, could not share the anxiety of the older women. The more
anxious gathered about the cake table. Four pathetically bedizened
middle-aged creatures, three too stout, one too thin, put their heads
together in conference. One woman was Mrs. Maria Dodge, Fanny's
mother, one was Mrs. Amos Dix, one was Mrs. Deacon Whittle, and one
was unmarried.</p>

<p>She was the stoutest of the four, tightly laced in an ancient
silk, with frizzed hair standing erect from bulging temples. She was
Lois Daggett, and a tragedy. She loved the young minister, Wesley
Elliot, with all her heart and soul and strength. She had fastened,
to attract his admiration, a little bunch of rose geranium leaves and
heliotrope in her tightly frizzed hair. That little posy had, all
unrecognized, a touching pathos. It was as the aigrette, the splendid
curves of waving plumage which birds adopt in the desire for love.
Lois had never had a lover. She had never been pretty, or attractive,
but always in her heart had been the hunger for love. The young
minister seemed the ideal of all the dreams of her life. He was as a
god to her. She trembled under his occasional glances, his casual
address caused vibrations in every nerve. She cherished no illusions.
She knew he was not for her, but she loved and worshipped, and she
tucked on an absurd little bow of ribbon, and she frizzed tightly her
thin hair, and she wore little posies, following out the primitive
instinct of her sex, even while her reason lagged behind. If once
Wesley should look at that pitiful little floral ornament, should
think it pretty, it would have meant as much to that starved virgin
soul as a kiss&mdash;to do her justice, as a spiritual kiss. There
was in reality only pathos and tragedy in her adoration. It was not
in the least earthy, or ridiculous, but it needed a saint to
understand that. Even while she conferred with her friends, she never
lost sight of the young man, always hoped for that one fleeting
glance of approbation.</p>

<p>When her sister-in-law, Mrs. Daggett, appeared, she restrained her
wandering eyes. All four women conferred anxiously. They, with Mrs.
Solomon Black, had engineered the fair. Mrs. Black had not yet
appeared and they all wondered why. Abby Daggett, who had the
expression of a saint&mdash;a fleshy saint, in old purple
muslin&mdash;gazed about her with admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't it look perfectly lovely!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whittle fairly snapped at her, like an angry old dog.
&ldquo;Lovely!&rdquo; said she with a fine edge of sarcasm in her
tone, &ldquo;perfectly lovely! Yes it does. But I think we are a set
of fools, the whole of us. Here we've got a fair all ready, and
worked our fingers to the bone (I don't know but I'll have a felon on
account of that drawn-in rug there) and we've used up all our butter
and eggs, and I don't see, for one, who is going to buy anything. I
ain't got any money t' spend. I don't believe Mrs. Slocum will come
over from Grenoble, and if she does, she can't buy
everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what made us get up the fair?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Dodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we all thought somebody might have some
money,&rdquo; ventured Abby Daggett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd like to know who? Not one of us four has, and I don't
believe Mrs. Solomon Black has, unless she turns in her egg-money,
and if she does I don't see how she is going to feed the minister.
Where is Phoebe Black?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is awfully late,&rdquo; said Lois. She looked at the
door, and, so doing, got a chance to observe the minister, who was
standing beside the flower-table talking to Ellen Dix. Fanny Dodge
was busily arranging some flowers, with her face averted. Ellen Dix
was very pretty, with an odd prettiness for a New England girl. Her
pale olive skin was flawless and fine of texture. Her mouth was
intensely red, and her eyes very dark and heavily shaded by long
lashes. She wore at the throat of her white dress a beautiful coral
brooch. It had been one of her mother's girlhood treasures. The Dix
family had been really almost opulent once, before the Andrew Bolton
cataclysm had involved the village, and there were still left in the
family little reminiscences of former splendor. Mrs. Dix wore a
superb old lace scarf over her ancient black silk, and a diamond
sparkled at her throat. The other women considered the lace much too
old and yellow to be worn, but Mrs. Dix was proud both of the lace
and her own superior sense of values. If the lace had been admired
she would not have cared so much for it.</p>

<p>Suddenly a little woman came hurrying up, her face sharp with
news. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; she said to the others.
&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stared at her. &ldquo;What do you mean, Mrs. Fulsom?&rdquo;
asked Mrs. Whittle acidly.</p>

<p>The little woman tossed her head importantly. &ldquo;Oh, nothing
much,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;only I thought the rest of you might
not know. Mrs. Solomon Black has got another boarder. That's what's
making her late. She had to get something for her to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another boarder!&rdquo; said Mrs. Whittle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the little woman, &ldquo;a young lady, and
Mrs. Solomon Black is on her way here now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With <em>her</em>?&rdquo; gasped the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she's coming, and she looks to me as if she might have
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Whittle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know? Mrs. Mixter's Tommy told my Sam, and he told
me, and I saw Mrs. Black and the boarder coming out of her yard, when
I went out of mine, and I hurried so's to get here first. Hush! Here
they come now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the women were conferring many people had entered the room,
although none had purchased the wares. Now there was stark silence
and a concentrated fire of attention as Mrs. Black entered with a
strange young woman. Mrs. Black looked doubtfully important. She, as
a matter of fact, was far from sure of her wisdom in the course she
was taking. She was even a little pale, and her lips moved nervously
as she introduced the girl to one and another. &ldquo;Miss
Orr,&rdquo; she said; sometimes &ldquo;Miss Lydia Orr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for the girl, she looked timid, yet determined. She was pretty,
perhaps a beauty, had she made the most of her personal advantages
instead of apparently ignoring them. Her beautiful fair hair, which
had red-gold lights, should have shaded her forehead, which was too
high. Instead it was drawn smoothly back, and fastened in a mat of
compact flat braids at the back of her head. She was dressed very
simply, in black, and her costume was not of the latest mode.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see anything about her to have made Mrs. Fulsom
think she was rich,&rdquo; Mrs. Whittle whispered to Mrs. Daggett,
who made an unexpectedly shrewd retort: &ldquo;I can see. She don't
look as if she cared what anybody thought of her clothes; as if she
had so much she's never minded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Whittle failed to understand. She grunted non-assent.
&ldquo;I don't see,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Her sleeves are way out
of date.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For awhile there was a loud buzz of conversation all over the
room. Then it ceased, for things were happening, amazing things. The
strange young lady was buying and she was paying cash down. Some of
the women examined the bank notes suspiciously and handed them to
their husbands to verify. The girl saw, and flushed, but she
continued. She went from table to table, and she bought everything,
from quilts and hideous drawn-in rugs to frosted cakes. She bought in
the midst of that ominous hush of suspicion. Once she even heard a
woman hiss to another, &ldquo;She's crazy. She got out of an insane
asylum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However nobody of all the stunned throng refused to sell. Her
first failure came in the case of a young man. He was Jim Dodge,
Fanny's brother. Jim Dodge was a sort of Ishmael in the village
estimation, and yet he was liked. He was a handsome young fellow with
a wild freedom of carriage. He had worked in the chair factory to
support his mother and sister, before it closed. He haunted the
woods, and made a little by selling skins. He had brought as his
contribution to the fair a beautiful fox skin, and when the young
woman essayed to buy that he strode forward. &ldquo;That is not for
sale,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I beg you to accept that as a gift, Miss
Orr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young fellow blushed a little before the girl's blue eyes,
although he held himself proudly. &ldquo;I won't have this sold to a
young lady who is buying as much as you are,&rdquo; he continued.</p>

<p>The girl hesitated. Then she took the skin. &ldquo;Thank you, it
is beautiful,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Jim's mother sidled close to him. &ldquo;You did just right,
Jim,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I don't know who she is, but I feel
ashamed of my life. She can't really want all that truck. She's
buying to help. I feel as if we were a parcel of beggars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she won't buy that fox skin to help!&rdquo; Jim
whispered back fiercely.</p>

<p>The whole did not take very long. Finally the girl talked in a low
voice to Mrs. Black who then became her spokeswoman. Mrs. Black now
looked confident, even triumphant. &ldquo;Miss Orr says of course she
can't possibly use all the cake and pies and jelly,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and she wants you to take away all you care for. And she wants
to know if Mrs. Whittle will let the other things stay here till
she's got a place to put them in. I tell her there's no room in my
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I s'pose so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Whittle in a thick voice. She
and many others looked fairly pale and shocked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Solomon Black, the girl and the minister went out.</p>

<p>The hush continued for a few seconds. Then Mrs. Whittle spoke.
&ldquo;There's something wrong about that girl,&rdquo; said she.
Other women echoed her. The room seemed full of feminine snarls.</p>

<p>Jim Dodge turned on them, and his voice rang out. &ldquo;You are a
lot of cats,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Come on home, mother and Fanny, I
am mortal shamed for the whole of it. That girl's buying to help,
when she can't want the things, and all you women turning on her for
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the Dodges had gone there was another hush. Then it was
broken by a man's voice, an old man's voice with a cackle of derision
and shrewd amusement in it. &ldquo;By gosh!&rdquo; said this voice,
resounding through the whole room, &ldquo;that strange young woman
has bought the whole church fair!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's something wrong,&rdquo; said Mrs. Whittle
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain't you got the money?&rdquo; queried the man's
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then for God's sake hang onto it!&rdquo;</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter III</h4>

<p>After Jim Dodge had taken his mother and sister home, he stole off
by himself for a solitary walk. The night was wonderful, and the
young man, who was in a whirl of undefined emotion, unconsciously
felt the need of a lesson of eternal peace. The advent of the strange
girl, and her unprecedented conduct had caused in him a sort of
masculine vertigo over the whole situation. Why in the name of common
sense was that girl in Brookville, and why should she have done such
a thing? He admired her; he was angry with her; he was puzzled by
her.</p>

<p>He did not like the minister. He did not wonder that Elliot should
wish for emolument enough to pay his way, but he had a little
contempt for him, for his assumption of such superior wisdom that he
could teach his fellow men spiritual knowledge and claim from them
financial reward. Aside from keeping those he loved in comfort, Jim
had no wish for money. He had all the beauty of nature for the
taking. He listened, as he strolled along, to the mysterious high
notes of insects and night-birds; he saw the lovely shadows of the
trees, and he honestly wondered within himself why Brookville people
considered themselves so wronged by an occurrence of years ago, for
which the perpetrator had paid so dearly. At the same time he
experienced a sense of angry humiliation at the poverty of the place
which had caused such an occurrence as that church fair.</p>

<p>When he reached Mrs. Solomon Black's house, he stared up at its
glossy whiteness, reflecting the moonlight like something infinitely
more precious than paint, and he seemed to perceive again a delicate,
elusive fragrance which he had noticed about the girl's raiment when
she thanked him for his fox skin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She smelled like a new kind of flower,&rdquo; Jim told
himself as he swung down the road. The expression was not elegant,
but it was sincere. He thought of the girl as he might have thought
of an entirely new species of blossom, with a strictly individual
fragrance which he had encountered in an expedition afield.</p>

<p>After he had left the Black house, there was only a half mile
before he reached the old Andrew Bolton place. The house had been
very pretentious in an ugly architectural period. There were
truncated towers, a mansard roof, hideous dormers, and a reckless
outbreak of perfectly useless bay windows. The house, which was
large, stood aloof from the road, with a small plantation of
evergreen trees before it. It had not been painted for years, and
loomed up like the vaguest shadow of a dwelling even in the brilliant
moonlight. Suddenly Jim caught sight of a tiny swinging gleam of
light. It bobbed along at the height of a man's knee. It was a
lantern, which seemed rather an odd article to be used on such a
night. Then Jim came face to face with the man who carried the
lantern, and saw who he was&mdash;Deacon Amos Whittle. To Jim's mind,
the man resembled a fox, skulking along the road, although Deacon
Amos Whittle was not predatory. He was a small, thin, wiry man with a
queer swirl of white whisker, and hopping gait.</p>

<p>He seemed somewhat blinded by his lantern, for he ran full tilt
into Jim, who stood the shock with such firmness that the older man
staggered back, and danced uncertainly to recover his balance. Deacon
Amos Whittle stuttered uncertain remarks, as was his wont when
startled. &ldquo;It is only Jim Dodge,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;Guess
your lantern sort of blinded you, Deacon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the lantern almost blinded Jim, for Whittle swung it higher
until it came on a level with Jim's eyes. Over it peered Whittle's
little keen ones, spectacled under a gray shag of eyebrows. &ldquo;Oh
it is you!&rdquo; said the man with a somewhat contemptuous accent.
He held Jim in slight esteem.</p>

<p>Jim laughed lightly. Unless he cared for people, their opinion of
him always seemed a perfectly negligible matter, and he did not care
at all for Amos Whittle.</p>

<p>Suddenly, to his amazement, Amos took hold of his coat.
&ldquo;Look a' here, Jim,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about that strange woman that's
boardin' to Mis' Solomon Black's?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How in creation should I know anything about
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hev you seen her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw her at the fair tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fair at my house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't know of any other fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't think of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim tried to pass, but the old man danced before him with his
swinging lantern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be going along,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute. Do you know she bought the whole
fair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. You are blinding me with that lantern, Deacon
Whittle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she paid good money down. I seen it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. I've got to get past you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute. Do you s'pose that young woman is all
right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see why not. Nothing against the law of the land
for her to buy out a church fair, that I know of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you think it looks sort of suspicious?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's none of my business. I confess I don't see why it's
suspicious, unless somebody wants to make her out a fool. I don't
understand what any sane person wants with all that truck; but I
don't pretend to understand women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whittle shook his head slowly. &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't know who does, or cares either. They've got
the money. I suppose that was what they were after.&rdquo;  Jim again
tried to pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait just a minute. Say, Jim, I'm going to tell you
something. Don't you speak of it till it gets out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire away. I'm in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wants to buy this old Bolton place here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim whistled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know the assignees of the Bolton estate had to take the
house, and it's been running down all these years, and a lot of money
has got to be spent on it or it'll tumble down. Now, this young woman
has offered to pay a good round sum for it, and take it just as it
is. S'pose it's all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How in creation should I know? If I held it, and wanted to
sell it, I'd know darn well whether it was all right or not. I
wouldn't go around asking other folks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you see it don't seem natural. Folks don't do things
like that. She's offering to pay more than the place is worth. She'll
have to spend thousands on it to make it fit to live in. She says
she'll pay cash, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose you'll know cash when you see it. I've got
to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But cash! Lord A'mighty! We dunno what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know whether you want to sell or
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want to sell! If we didn't want to sell this old shebang
we'd be dumb idiots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, why in the name of common sense don't you
sell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, somehow it don't look natural to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I must confess that to throw away much money on an
old shell like that doesn't look any too natural to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come now, Jim, that was a real nice house when it was
built.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim laughed sarcastically. &ldquo;Running up your wares now, are
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That house cost Andrew Bolton a pile of money. And now, if
it's fixed up, it'll be the best house in Brookville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That isn't saying much. See here, you've got to let me
pass. If you want to sell&mdash;I should think you would&mdash;I
don't see what you are worrying about. I don't suppose you are
worrying for fear you may cheat the girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ain't goin' to cheat the girl, but&mdash;I dunno.&rdquo;
 Whittle stood aside, shaking his head, and Jim passed on. He
loitered along the shaggy hedge which bordered the old Bolton estate,
and a little farther, then turned back. He had reached the house
again when he started. In front of the gate stood a shadowy figure, a
woman, by the outlines of the dress. Jim continued hesitatingly. He
feared to startle her. But he did not. When he came abreast of her,
she turned and looked full in his face, and he recognized Miss Orr.
He took off his hat, but was so astonished he could scarcely utter a
greeting. The girl was so shy that she stammered a little, but she
laughed too, like a child caught in some mischief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so glad it is you!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, taking all things into consideration, so am I,&rdquo;
said Jim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean it is pretty late for you to be out alone, and I'm
as good as a Sunday School picnic, with the superintendent and the
minister thrown in, for you to meet. I'll see you home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness! There's nothing to be afraid of in this little
place,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I have lived in New
York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where there are policemen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, but one never counts on that. One never counts on
anything in New York. You can't, you know. Its mathematics are as
high as its buildings, too high to take chances. But here&mdash;why,
I saw pretty near the whole village at that funny fair, didn't
I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, but Brookville is not a walled town. People not
so desirable as those you saw at the fair have free entrance and
egress. It is pretty late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not in the least afraid,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no reason to be, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean because you have happened along. Well, I am glad
you did. I begun to think it was rather late myself for me to be
prowling around, but you will simply have to leave me before I get to
my boarding house. That Mrs. Black is as kind as can be, but she
doesn't know what to make of me, and on the whole I think I would
rather take my chances stealing in alone than to have her spy
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wanted to come out, why didn't you ask the minister
to come with you?&rdquo; Jim asked bluntly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The minister! Oh, I don't like ministers when they are
young. They are much better when all the doctrines they have learned
at their theological seminaries have settled in their minds, and have
stopped bubbling. However, this minister here seems rather nice, very
young, but he doesn't give the impression of taking himself so
seriously that he is a nervous wreck on account of his convictions. I
wouldn't have asked him for the world. In the first place, Mrs. Black
would have thought it very queer, and in the second place he was so
hopping mad about that fair, and having me buy it, that he wouldn't
have been agreeable. I don't blame him. I would feel just so in his
place. It must be frightful to be a poor minister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None too pleasant, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right, it certainly is not. I have been poor
myself, and I know. I went to my room, and looked out of the window,
and it was so perfectly beautiful outdoors, and I did want to see how
this place looked by moonlight, so I just went down the back stairs
and came alone. I hope nobody will break in while I am gone. I left
the door unlocked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No burglars live in Brookville,&rdquo; said Jim.
&ldquo;Mighty good reasons for none to come in, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What reasons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a blessed thing to burgle. Never has been for
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a silence. The girl spoke in a hushed voice.
&ldquo;I&mdash;understand,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that the people
here hold the man who used to live in this house responsible for
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I suppose he was. Brookville never would have
been a Tuxedo under any circumstances, but I reckon it would have
fared a little better if Mr. Bolton hadn't failed to see the
difference between mine and thine. I was nothing but a kid, but I
have heard a good deal about it. Some of the older people are pretty
bitter, and some of the younger ones have it in their veins. I
suppose the poor man did start us down hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say &lsquo;poor man&rsquo;; why?&rdquo; asked the girl
and her voice trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, yes. I'm like a hound sneaking round back doors for
bones, on account of Mr. Bolton, myself. My father lost more than
'most anybody, but I wouldn't change places with the man. Say, do you
know he has been in State's Prison for years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course any man who does wrong is a poor man, even if he
doesn't get caught. I'm mighty glad I wasn't born bitter as some of
the people here were. My sister Fanny isn't either. She doesn't have
much, poor girl, but I've never heard her say one word, and mother
never blames it on Mr. Bolton, either. Mother says he is getting his
punishment, and it isn't for any of us to add to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your sister was that pretty girl at the flower
table?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I suppose you would call her pretty. I don't
really know. A fellow never does know, when the girl is his sister.
She may look the best of the bunch to him, but he's never
sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is lovely,&rdquo; said Lydia Orr. She pointed to the
shadowy house. &ldquo;That must have been a nice place
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best in the village; show place. Say, what in the name of
common sense do you want to buy it for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I met old Whittle just before I met you. He told me.
The place must be terribly run down. It will cost a mint of money to
get it in shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have considerable money,&rdquo; stated the girl quite
simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it's none of my business, but you will have to sink
considerable in that place, and perhaps when you are through it won't
be satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have taken a notion to it,&rdquo; said the girl. She
spoke very shyly. Her curiously timid, almost apologetic manner
returned suddenly. &ldquo;I suppose it does look strange,&rdquo; she
added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody's business how it looks,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;but
I think you ought to know the truth about it, and I think I am more
likely to give you information than Whittle. Of course he has an ax
to grind. Perhaps if I had an ax to grind, you couldn't trust
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I could,&rdquo; returned the girl with conviction.
&ldquo;I knew that the minute I looked at you. I always know the
people I can trust. I know I could not trust Deacon Whittle. I made
allowances, the way one does for a clock that runs too fast or too
slow. I think one always has to be doing addition or subtraction with
people, to understand them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you had better try a little subtraction with
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't have to. I didn't mean with everybody. Of course
there are exceptions. That was a beautiful skin you gave me. I didn't
half thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense. I was glad to give it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you hunt much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About all I am good for except to run our little farm and
do odd jobs. I used to work in the chair factory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn't think you would have liked that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn't; had to do what I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you like to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't know. I never had any choice, so I never gave
it any thought. Something that would keep me out of doors, I
reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know much about plants and trees?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know whether I know much; I love them, that's
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could do some landscape gardening for a place like
this, I should think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim stared at her, and drew himself up haughtily. &ldquo;It really
is late, Miss Orr,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think, if you will allow
me, I will take you home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you angry about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are. You are angry because I said that about
landscape gardening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a beggar or a man who undertakes a job he is not
competent to perform, if I am poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you undertake setting those grounds to rights, if I
buy the place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you hire a regular landscape man if you have so
much money?&rdquo; asked Jim rudely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather have you. I want somebody I can work with. I
have my own ideas. I want to hire you to work with me. Will
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time enough to settle that when you've bought the place.
You must go home now. Here, take my arm. This sidewalk is an apology
for one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia took the young man's arm obediently, and they began
walking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth are you going to do with all that truck you
bought?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>

<p>Lydia laughed. &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I haven't the
slightest idea,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Pretty awful, most of it,
isn't it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't give it house room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won't either. I bought it, but I won't have
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must take us for a pretty set of paupers, to throw away
money like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, don't you get mad again. I did want to buy it. I never
wanted to buy things so much in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw such a queer girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will know I am not queer some time, and I would tell
you why now, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you tell me a thing you don't want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I had better wait just a little. But I don't know
about all those things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, why don't you send them to missionaries out
West?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, could I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you can. What's to hinder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I buy that place will you help me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will. Now you are talking! I'm glad to do
anything like that. I think I'd be nutty if I had to live in the same
house as that fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl burst into a lovely peal of laughter. &ldquo;Exactly what
I thought all the time,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I wanted to buy them;
you don't know how much; but it was like buying rabbits, and white
elephants, and&mdash;oh, I don't know! a perfect menagerie of things
I couldn't bear to live with, and I didn't see how I could give them
away, and I couldn't think of a place to throw them away.&rdquo;  She
laughed again.</p>

<p>Jim stopped suddenly. &ldquo;Say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it will be an awful piece of work to pack off all
those contraptions, and it strikes me it is pretty hard on the
missionaries. There's a gravel pit down back of the Bolton place, and
if you buy it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, bury the fair there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia stopped short, and laughed till she cried. &ldquo;You don't
suppose they would ever find out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust me. You just have the whole lot moved into the house,
and we'll fix it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can't tell you how thankful I am to you,&rdquo; said
Lydia fervently. &ldquo;I felt like a nightmare with all those
things. Some of them can be used of course, but some&mdash;oh, those
picture throws, and those postage stamp plates!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are funny, but sort of pitiful, too,&rdquo; said Jim.
&ldquo;Women are sort of pitiful, lots of them. I'm glad I am a
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you would be,&rdquo; said the girl. She
looked up in his face with an expression which he did not see. He was
regarding women in the abstract; she was suddenly regarding men in
the individual.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter IV</h4>

<p>Elliot slept later than usual the morning after the fair.
Generally he slept the beautiful, undisturbed sleep of the young and
healthy; that night, for some reason, he did not. Possibly the
strange break which the buying of the fair had made in the course of
his everyday life caused one also between his conscious and
unconscious state, which his brain refused to bridge readily. Wesley
had not been brought face to face, many times in his life, with the
unprecedented. He had been brought before it, although in a limited
fashion, at the church fair. The unprecedented is more or less
shattering, partaking of the nature of a spiritual bomb. Lydia Orr's
mad purchase of that collection of things called a fair disturbed his
sense of values. He asked himself over and over who was this girl?
More earnestly he asked himself what her motives could be.</p>

<p>But the question which most agitated him was his relations with
the girl, Fanny Dodge. He realized that recently he had approached
the verge of an emotional crisis. If Mrs. Black whom he had at the
time fairly cursed in his heart, in spite of his profession, had not
appeared with her notice of dinner, he would be in a most unpleasant
predicament. Only the girl's innate good sense could have served as a
refuge, and he reflected with the utmost tenderness that he might
confidently rely upon that. He was almost sure that the poor girl
loved him. He was quite sure that he loved her. But he was also sure,
with a strong sense of pride in her, that she would have refused him,
not on mercenary grounds, for Fanny he knew would have shared a crust
and hovel with the man she loved; but Fanny would love the man too
well to consent to the crust and the hovel, on his own account. She
would not have said in so many words, &ldquo;What! marry you, a
minister so poor that a begging fair has to be held to pay his
salary?&rdquo;  She would have not refused him her love and sympathy,
but she would have let him down so gently from the high prospect of
matrimony that he would have suffered no jolt.</p>

<p>Elliot was a good fellow. It was on the girl's account that he
suffered. He suffered, as a matter of course. He wanted Fanny badly,
but he realized himself something of a cad. He discounted his own
suffering; perhaps, as he told himself with sudden suspicion of
self-conceit, he overestimated hers. Still, he was sure that the girl
would suffer more than he wished. He blamed himself immeasurably. He
tried to construct air castles which would not fall, even before the
impact of his own thoughts, in which he could marry this girl and
live with her happily ever after, but the man had too much common
sense. He did not for a moment now consider the possibility of
stepping, without influence, into a fat pastorate. He was sure that
he could count confidently upon nothing better than this.</p>

<p>The next morning he looked about his room wearily, and a plan
which he had often considered grew upon him. He got the keys of the
unoccupied parsonage next door, from Mrs. Black, and went over the
house after breakfast. It was rather a spacious house, old, but in
tolerable preservation. There was a southeast room of one story in
height, obviously an architectural afterthought, which immediately
appealed to him. It was practically empty except for charming
possibilities, but it contained a few essentials, and probably the
former incumbent had used it as a study. There was a wood stove, a
standing desk fixed to the wall, some shelves, an old table, and a
couple of armchairs. Wesley at once resolved to carry out his plan.
He would move his small store of books from his bedroom at Mrs.
Black's, arrange them on the shelves, and set up his study there. He
was reasonably sure of obtaining wood enough for a fire to heat the
room when the weather was cold.</p>

<p>He returned and told Mrs. Black, who agreed with him that the plan
was a good one. &ldquo;A minister ought to have his study,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;and of course the parsonage is at your disposal. The
parish can't rent it. That room used to be the study, and you will
have offers of all the wood you want to heat it. There's plenty of
cut wood that folks are glad to donate. They've always sent loads of
wood to heat the minister's study. Maybe they thought they'd stand
less chance of hell fire if they heated up the gospel in this
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I'll move my books and writing materials right over
there,&rdquo; said Elliot with a most boyish glee.</p>

<p>Mrs. Black nodded approvingly. &ldquo;So I would.&rdquo;  She
hesitated a moment, then she spoke again. &ldquo;I was just a little
bit doubtful about taking that young woman in yesterday,&rdquo; said
she.</p>

<p>Elliot regarded her curiously. &ldquo;Then you never had met her
before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she just landed here with her trunk. The garage man
brought her, and she said he told her I took boarders, and she asked
me to take her. I don't know but I was kind of weak to give in, but
the poor little thing looked sort of nice, and her manners were
pretty, so I took her. I thought I would ask you how you felt about
it this morning, but there ain't any reason to, perhaps, for she
ain't going to stay here very long, anyway. She says she's going to
buy the old Bolton place and have it fixed up and settle down there
as soon as she can. She told me after you had gone out. She's gone
now to look at it. Mr. Whittle was going to meet her there. Queer,
ain't it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does look extraordinary, rather,&rdquo; agreed Elliot,
&ldquo;but Miss Orr may be older than she looks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she ain't old, but she's of age. She told me that, and
I guess she's got plenty of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Elliot, &ldquo;that is rather a fine old
place. She may be connected with the Bolton family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's exactly what I think, and if she was she wouldn't
mention it, of course. I think she's getting the house in some sort
of a business way. Andrew Bolton may have died in prison by this
time, and she may be an heir. I think she is going to be married and
have the house fixed up to live in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds very probable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it does; but what gets me is her buying that fair. I
own I felt a little scared, and wondered if she had all her buttons,
but when she told me about the house I knew of course she could use
the things for furnishing, all except the cake and candy, and I
suppose if she's got a lot of money she thought she'd like to buy to
help. I feel glad she's coming. She may be a real help in the church.
Now don't color up. Ministers have to take help. It's part of their
discipline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes Mrs. Solomon Black said a wise and consoling thing.
Elliot, moving his effects to the old parsonage, considered that she
had done so then. &ldquo;She is right. I have no business to be proud
in the profession calling for the lowly-hearted of the whole
world,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>

<p>After he had his books arranged he sat down in an armchair beside
a front window, and felt rather happy and at home. He reproached
himself for his content when he read the morning paper, and
considered the horrors going on in Europe. Why should he, an
able-bodied man, sit securely in a room and gaze out at a peaceful
village street? he asked himself as he had scores of times before.
Then the imperial individual, which obtrudes even when conscience
cries out against it, occupied his mind. Pretty Fanny Dodge in her
blue linen was passing. She never once glanced at the parsonage.
Forgetting his own scruples and resolves, he thought unreasonably
that she might at least glance up, if she had the day before at all
in her mind. Suddenly the unwelcome reflection that he might not be
as desirable as he had thought himself came over him.</p>

<p>He got up, put on his hat, and walked rapidly in the direction of
the old Bolton house. Satisfying his curiosity might serve as a
palliative to his sudden depression with regard to his love affair.
It is very much more comfortable to consider oneself a cad, and
acknowledge to oneself love for a girl, and be sure of her
unfortunate love for you, than to consider oneself the dupe of the
girl. Fanny had a keen sense of humor. Suppose she had been making
fun of him. Suppose she had her own aspirations in other quarters. He
walked on until he reached the old Bolton house. The door stood open,
askew upon rusty hinges. Wesley Elliot entered and glanced about him
with growing curiosity. The room was obviously a kitchen, one side
being occupied by a huge brick chimney inclosing a built-in range
half devoured with rust; wall cupboards, a sink and a decrepit table
showed gray and ugly in the greenish light of two tall windows,
completely blocked on the outside with over-grown shrubs. An
indescribable odor of decaying plaster, chimney-soot and mildew hung
in the heavy air.</p>

<p>A door to the right, also half open, led the investigator further.
Here the floor shook ominously under foot, suggesting rotten beams
and unsteady sills. The minister walked cautiously, noting in passing
a portrait defaced with cobwebs over the marble mantelpiece and the
great circular window opening upon an expanse of tangled grass and
weeds, through which the sun streamed hot and yellow. Voices came
from an adjoining room; he could hear Deacon Whittle's nasal tones
upraised in fervid assertion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am!&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;this house is a
little out of repair, you can see that fer yourself; but it's well
built; couldn't be better. A few hundred dollars expended here an'
there'll make it as good as new; in fact, I'll say better'n new! They
don't put no such material in houses nowadays. Why, this
woodwork&mdash;doors, windows, floors and all&mdash;is clear, white
pine. You can't buy it today for no price. Costs as much as m'hogany,
come to figure it out. Yes, <em>ma'am!</em> the woodwork alone in
this house is worth the price of one of them little new shacks a
builder'll run up in a couple of months. And look at them
mantelpieces, pure tombstone marble; and all carved like you see.
Yes, ma'am! there's as many as seven of 'em in the house. Where'll
you find anything like that, I'd like to know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;think the house might be made to look very
pleasant, Mr. Whittle,&rdquo; Lydia replied, in a hesitating
voice.</p>

<p>Wesley Elliot fancied he could detect a slight tremor in its even
flow. He pushed open the door and walked boldly in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Miss Orr,&rdquo; he exclaimed, advancing with
outstretched hand. &ldquo;Good-morning, Deacon! ...Well, well! what a
melancholy old ruin this is, to be sure. I never chanced to see the
interior before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deacon Whittle regarded his pastor sourly from under puckered
brows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some s'prised to see <em>you</em>, dominie,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Thought you was generally occupied at your desk of a Friday
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The minister included Lydia Orr in the genial warmth of his smile
as he replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a special call into the country this morning, and
seeing your conveyance hitched to the trees outside, Deacon, I
thought I'd step in. I'm not sure it's altogether safe for all of us
to be standing in the middle of this big room, though. Sills pretty
well rotted out&mdash;eh, Deacon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sound as an oak,&rdquo; snarled the Deacon. &ldquo;As I was
telling th' young lady, there ain't no better built house anywheres
'round than this one. Andrew Bolton didn't spare other folks' money
when he built it&mdash;no, <em>sir!</em>  It's good for a hundred
years yet, with trifling repairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who owns the house now?&rdquo; asked Lydia unexpectedly.
She had walked over to one of the long windows opening on a rickety
balcony and stood looking out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who owns it?&rdquo; echoed Deacon Whittle. &ldquo;Well,
now, we can give you a clear title, ma'am, when it comes to that;
sound an' clear. You don't have to worry none about that. You see it
was this way; dunno as anybody's mentioned it in your hearing since
you come to Brookville; but we use to have a bank here in Brookville,
about eighteen years ago, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ellen Dix told me,&rdquo; interrupted Lydia Orr,
without turning her head. &ldquo;Has nobody lived here
since?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deacon Whittle cast an impatient glance at Wesley Elliot, who
stood with his eyes fixed broodingly on the dusty floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There'd have been plenty of
folks glad enough to live here; but the house wa'n't really suited to
our kind o' folks. It wa'n't a farm&mdash;there being only twenty
acres going with it. And you see the house is different to what folks
in moderate circumstances could handle. Nobody had the cash to buy
it, an' ain't had, all these years. It's a pity to see a fine old
property like this a-going down, all for the lack of a few hundreds.
But if you was to buy it, ma'am, I could put it in shape fer you,
equal to the best, and at a figure&mdash; Wall; I tell ye, it won't
cost ye what some folks'd think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn't that man&mdash;the banker who
stole&mdash;everybody's money, I mean&mdash;didn't he have any
family?&rdquo; asked Lydia, still without turning her head. &ldquo;I
suppose he&mdash;he died a long time ago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see the matter of th' title's worrying you, ma'am,&rdquo;
said Deacon Whittle briskly. &ldquo;I like to see a female cautious
in a business way: I do, indeed. And 'tain't often you see it,
neither. Now, I'll tell <em>you</em>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn't it be well to show Miss Orr some more desirable
property, Deacon?&rdquo; interposed Wesley Elliot. &ldquo;It seems to
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shall buy the house,&rdquo; said the girl at the
window, quickly.</p>

<p>She turned and faced the two men, her delicate head thrown back, a
clear color staining her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall buy it,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I&mdash;I like
it very much. It is just what I wanted&mdash;in&mdash;in every
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deacon Whittle gave vent to a snort of astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was another party looking at the place a spell
back,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his dry old hands. &ldquo;I dunno's I
exac'ly give him an option on it; but I was sort of looking for him
to turn up 'most any day. Course I'd have to give him the first
chance, if it comes to a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is an option?&rdquo; asked Lydia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An option is a&mdash;now, let me see if I can make a legal
term plain to the female mind: An option, my dear young lady,
is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The minister crossed the floor to where the girl was standing, a
slight, delicate figure in her black dress, her small face under the
shadowy brim of her wide had looking unnaturally pale in the greenish
light from without.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An option,&rdquo; he interposed hurriedly, &ldquo;must be
bought with money; should you change your mind later you lose
whatever you have paid. Let me advise you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deacon Whittle cleared his throat with an angry, rasping
sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me an' this young lady came here this morning for the
purpose of transacting a little business, mutually
advantageous,&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;If it was anybody but the
dominie, I should say he was butting in without cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don't, please!&rdquo; begged the girl. &ldquo;Mr.
Elliot meant it kindly, I'm sure. I&mdash;I want an option, if you
please. You'll let me have it, won't you? I want
it&mdash;now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deacon Whittle blinked and drew back a pace or two, as if her
eagerness actually frightened him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I can accommodate ye,&rdquo; he stuttered;
&ldquo;but&mdash;there'll be some preliminaries&mdash;I wa'n't
exactly prepared&mdash; There's the price of the property and the
terms&mdash; S'pose likely you'll want a
mortgage&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rubbed his bristly chin dubiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to buy the house,&rdquo; Lydia said. &ldquo;I want
to be sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen the rooms upstairs?&rdquo; asked the
minister, turning his back upon his senior deacon.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, why not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wesley Elliot took a step or two toward the winding stair, dimly
seen through the gloom of the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, dominie, them stairs ain't safe!&rdquo; warned the
Deacon. &ldquo;They'll mebbe want a little shoring up, before&mdash;
Say, I wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care to go up now, really,&rdquo; protested the
girl. &ldquo;It&mdash;it's the location I like and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She glanced about the desolate place with a shiver. The air of the
long-closed rooms was chilly, despite the warmth of the June day
outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll tell you what,&rdquo; said the deacon briskly.
&ldquo;You come right along down to the village with me, Miss Orr.
It's kind of close in here; the house is built so tight, there can't
no air git in. I tell you, them walls&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smote the one nearest him with a jocular palm. There followed
the hollow sound of dropping plaster from behind the lath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess we'd better fix things up between us, so you won't be
noways disappointed in case that other party&mdash;&rdquo; he added,
with a crafty glance at the minister. &ldquo;You see, he might turn
up 'most any day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, walking hurriedly to
the door. &ldquo;I&mdash;I should like to go at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned and held out her hand to the minister with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for coming,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wanted you
to see the house as it is now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked down into her upturned face with its almost childish
appeal of utter candor, frowning slightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you no one&mdash;that is, no near relative to advise
you in the matter?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;The purchase of a large
property, such as this, ought to be carefully considered, I should
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deacon Whittle coughed in an exasperated manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we'd better be gitting along,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;if we want to catch Jedge Fulsom in his office before he goes
to dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia turned obediently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm coming,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Then to Elliot: &ldquo;No; there is no one to&mdash;to advise me.
I am obliged to decide for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wesley Elliot returned to Brookville and his unfinished sermon by
a long detour which led him over the shoulder of a hill overlooking
the valley. He did not choose to examine his motive for avoiding the
road along which Fanny Dodge would presently return. But as the path,
increasingly rough and stony as it climbed the steep ascent, led him
at length to a point from whence he could look down upon a toy
village, arranged in stiff rows about a toy church, with its tiny
pointing steeple piercing the vivid green of many trees, he sat down
with a sigh of relief and something very like gratitude.</p>

<p>As far back as he could remember Wesley Elliot had cherished a
firm, though somewhat undefined, belief in a quasi-omnipotent power
to be reckoned as either hostile or friendly to the purposes of man,
showing now a smiling, now a frowning face. In short, that
unquestioned, wholly uncontrollable influence outside of a man's
life, which appears to rule his destiny. In this r&ocirc;le
&ldquo;Providence,&rdquo; as he had been taught to call it, had
heretofore smiled rather evasively upon Wesley Elliot. He had been
permitted to make sure his sacred calling; but he had not secured the
earnestly coveted city pulpit. On the other hand, he had just been
saved&mdash;or so he told himself, as the fragrant June breeze fanned
his heated forehead&mdash;by a distinct intervention of
&ldquo;Providence&rdquo; from making a fool of himself. His
subsequent musings, interrupted at length by the shrieking whistle of
the noon train as it came to a standstill at the toy railway station,
might be termed important, since they were to influence the immediate
future of a number of persons, thus affording a fresh illustration of
the mysterious workings of &ldquo;Providence,&rdquo; sometimes called
&ldquo;Divine.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter V</h4>

<p>There existed in Brookville two separate and distinct forums for
the discussion of topics of public and private interest. These were
the barroom of the village tavern, known as the Brookville House, and
Henry Daggett's General Store, located on the corner opposite the old
Bolton Bank Building. Mr. Daggett, besides being Brookville's leading
merchant, was also postmaster, and twice each day withdrew to the
official privacy of the office for the transaction of United States
business. The post office was conveniently located in one corner of
Mr. Daggett's store and presented to the inquiring eye a small glass
window, which could be raised and lowered at will by the person
behind the partition, a few numbered boxes and a slit, marked
&ldquo;Letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the evening of the day on which Miss Lydia Orr had visited the
old Bolton house in company with Deacon Whittle, both forums were in
full blast. The wagon-shed behind the Brookville House sheltered an
unusual number of &ldquo;rigs,&rdquo; whose owners, after partaking
of liquid refreshment dispensed by the oily young man behind the bar,
by common consent strolled out to the veranda where a row of battered
wooden armchairs invited to reposeful consideration of the surprising
events of the past few days.</p>

<p>The central chair supported the large presence of
&ldquo;Judge&rdquo; Fulsom, who was dispensing both information and
tobacco juice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The practice of the legal profession,&rdquo; said the
Judge, after a brief period devoted to the ruminative processes,
&ldquo;is full of surprises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having spoken, Judge Fulsom folded his fat hands across the
somewhat soiled expanse of his white waistcoat and relapsed into a
weighty silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They was sayin' over to the post office this evening that
the young woman that cleaned up the church fair has bought the old
Bolton place. How about it, Jedge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judge Fulsom grunted, as he leveled a displeased stare upon the
speaker, a young farmer with a bibulous eye and slight swagger of
defiance. At the proper moment, with the right audience, the Judge
was willing to impart information with lavish generosity. But any
attempt to force his hand was looked upon as a distinct infringement
of his privilege.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to keep your face shut, Lute, till th' Jedge gets
ready to talk,&rdquo; counseled a middle-aged man who sat tilted back
in the next chair. &ldquo;Set down, son, and cool off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see I got to hurry along,&rdquo; objected the
young farmer impatiently, &ldquo;and I wanted to know if there was
anything in it. Our folks had money in the old bank, an' we'd give up
getting anything more out the smash years ago. But if the Bolton
place has actually been sold&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He finished with a prolonged whistle.</p>

<p>The greatness in the middle chair emitted a grunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he muttered, and again,
&ldquo;Hr-m-m-ph!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be surprising,&rdquo; conceded the middle-aged
man, &ldquo;after all these years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Considerable many of th' creditors has died since,&rdquo;
piped up a lean youth who was smoking a very large cigar. &ldquo;I
s'pose th' children of all such would come in for their
share&mdash;eh, Judge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judge Fulsom frowned and pursed his lips thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The proceedings has not yet reached the point you mention,
Henry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You're going a little too
fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody spoke, but the growing excitement took the form of a
shuffling of feet. The Judge deliberately lighted his pipe, a token
of mental relaxation. Then from out the haze of blue smoke, like the
voice of an oracle from the seclusion of a shrine, issued the
familiar recitative tone for which everybody had been waiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, boys, I'll tell you how 'twas: Along about ten
minutes of twelve I had my hat on my head, and was just drawing on my
linen duster with the idea of going home to dinner, when I happened
to look out of my office window, and there was Deacon
Whittle&mdash;and the girl, just coming up th' steps. In five minutes
more I'd have been gone, most likely for the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; breathed the excitable young farmer.</p>

<p>The middle-aged man sternly motioned him to keep silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I s'pose most of you boys saw her at the fair last
night,&rdquo; proceeded the Judge, ignoring the interruption.
&ldquo;She's a nice appearing young female; but nobody'd think to
look at her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused to ram down the tobacco in the glowing bowl of his
pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as I was saying, she'd been over to the Bolton house
with the Deacon. Guess we'll have to set the Deacon down for a right
smart real-estate boomer. We didn't none of us give him credit for
it. He'd got the girl all worked up to th' point of bein' afraid
another party'd be right along to buy the place. She wanted an option
on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; again interrupted the young farmer
disgustedly. &ldquo;Them options ain't no good. I had one once on
five acres of timber, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Lute!&rdquo; came in low chorus from the
spell-bound audience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wanted an option,&rdquo; repeated Judge Fulsom loudly,
&ldquo;just till I could fix up the paper. &lsquo;And, if you
please,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I'd like t' pay five thousand dollars
for the option, then I'd feel more sure.&rsquo;  And before I had a
chance to open my mouth, she whips out a check-book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gr-reat jumping Judas!&rdquo; cried the irrepressible Lute,
whose other name was Parsons. &ldquo;Five thousand dollars! Why, the
old place ain't worth no five thousand dollars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judge Fulsom removed his pipe from his mouth, knocked out the
half-burned tobacco, blew through the stem, then proceeded to fill
and light it again. From the resultant haze issued his voice once
more, bland, authoritative, reminiscent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, son, that depends on how you look at it. Time
was when Andrew Bolton wouldn't have parted with the place for three
times that amount. It was rated, I remember, at eighteen thousand,
including live stock, conveyances an' furniture, when it was deeded
over to the assignees. We sold out the furniture and stock at auction
for about half what they were worth. But there weren't any bidders
worth mentioning for the house and land. So it was held by the
assignees&mdash;Cephas Dix, Deacon Whittle and myself&mdash;for
private sale. We could have sold it on easy terms the next year for
six thousand; but in process of trying to jack up our customer to
seven, we lost out on the deal. But now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judge Fulsom arose, brushed the tobacco from his waistcoat front
and cleared his throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess I'll have to be getting along,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;important papers to look over, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A female woman, like her, is likely to change her mind
before tomorrow morning,&rdquo; said the middle-aged man dubiously.
&ldquo;And I heard Mrs. Solomon Black had offered to sell her place
to the young woman for twenty-nine hundred&mdash;all in good repair
and neat as wax. She might take it into her head to buy
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right in the village, too,&rdquo; growled Lute Parsons.
&ldquo;Say, Jedge, did you give her that option she was looking for?
Because if you did she can't get out of it so easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judge Fulsom twinkled pleasantly over his bulging cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sure did accommodate the young lady with the option, as
aforesaid,&rdquo; he vouchsafed. &ldquo;And what's more, I telephoned
to the Grenoble Bank to see if her check for five thousand dollars
was O. K.... Well; so long, boys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stepped ponderously down from the piazza and turned his broad
back on the row of excited faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Jedge!&rdquo; the middle-aged man called after
him. &ldquo;Was her check any good? You didn't tell us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Judge did not reply. He merely waved his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's going over to the post office,&rdquo; surmised the
lean youth, shifting the stub of his cigar to the corner of his mouth
in a knowing manner.</p>

<p>He lowered his heels to the floor with a thud and prepared to
follow. Five minutes later the bartender, not hearing the familiar
hum of voices from the piazza, thrust his head out of the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he called out to the hatchet-faced woman who
was writing down sundry items in a ledger at a high desk. &ldquo;The
boys has all cleared out. What's up, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They'll be back,&rdquo; said the woman imperturbably,
&ldquo;an' more with 'em. You want t' git your glasses all washed up,
Gus; an' you may as well fetch up another demijohn out the
cellar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was it foreknowledge, or merely coincidence which at this same
hour led Mrs. Solomon Black, frugally inspecting her supplies for
tomorrow morning's breakfast, to discover that her baking-powder can
was empty?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll have to roll out a few biscuits for their
breakfast,&rdquo; she decided, &ldquo;or else I'll run short of bread
for dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her two boarders, Lydia Orr and the minister, were sitting on the
piazza, engaged in what appeared to be a most interesting
conversation, when Mrs. Black unlatched the front gate and emerged
upon the street, her second-best hat carefully disposed upon her
water-waves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won't be gone a minute,&rdquo; she paused to assure them;
&ldquo;I just got to step down to the grocery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sudden hush fell upon a loud and excited conversation when Mrs.
Solomon Black, very erect as to her spinal column and noticeably
composed and dignified in her manner, entered Henry Daggett's store.
She walked straight past the group of men who stood about the door to
the counter, where Mr. Daggett was wrapping in brown paper two large
dill pickles dripping sourness for a small girl with straw-colored
pig-tails.</p>

<p>Mr. Daggett beamed cordially upon Mrs. Black, as he dropped two
copper pennies in his cash-drawer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, ma'am,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What can I do
for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A ten-cent can of baking-powder, if you please,&rdquo;
replied the lady primly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must take a lot of victuals to feed them two boarders o'
yourn,&rdquo; hazarded Mr. Daggett, still cordially, and with a dash
of confidential sympathy in his voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Daggett had, by virtue of long association with his wife,
acquired something of her spontaneous warm-heartedness. He had found
it useful in his business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they ain't neither of 'em so hearty,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Black, searching in her pocket-book with the air of one who is in
haste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We was just speakin' about the young woman that's stopping
at your house,&rdquo; murmured Mr. Daggett. &ldquo;Let me see; I
disremember which kind of bakin'-powder you use, Mis'
Black.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Golden Rule brand, if you please, Mr.
Daggett.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H'm; let me see if I've got one of them Golden Rules
left,&rdquo; mused Mr. Daggett.... &ldquo;I told the boys I guessed
she was some relation of th' Grenoble Orrs, an'
mebbe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; she ain't,&rdquo; denied Mrs. Black crisply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M-m-m?&rdquo; interrogated Mr. Daggett, intent upon a
careful search among the various canned products on his shelf.
&ldquo;How'd she happen to come to Brookville?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Black tossed her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it ain't for me to say,&rdquo; she returned, with
a dignity which made her appear taller than she really was.
&ldquo;But folks has heard of the table I set, 'way to
Boston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't say!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Daggett. &ldquo;So she
come from Boston, did she? I thought she seemed kind
of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know as there's any secret about where she
<em>come</em> from,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Black aggressively. &ldquo;I
never s'posed there was. Folks ain't had time to git acquainted with
her yit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Daggett, as if the idea was a
new and valuable one. &ldquo;Yes, ma'am; you're right! we ain't none
of us had time to git acquainted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He beamed cordially upon Mrs. Black over the tops of his
spectacles. &ldquo;Looks like we're going to git a chance to know
her,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;It seems the young woman has made up
her mind to settle amongst us. Yes, ma'am; we've been hearing she's
on the point of buying property and settling right down here in
Brookville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An excited buzz of comment in the front of the store broke in upon
this confidential conversation. Mrs. Black appeared to become aware
for the first time of the score of masculine eyes fixed upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain't you got any of the Golden Rule?&rdquo; she demanded
sharply. &ldquo;That looks like it to me&mdash;over in behind them
cans of tomatoes. It's got a blue label.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; here 'tis, sure enough,&rdquo; admitted Mr.
Daggett. &ldquo;I guess I must be losing my eyesight.... It's going
to be quite a chore to fix up the old Bolton house,&rdquo; he added,
as he inserted the blue labeled can of reputation in a red and yellow
striped paper bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That ain't decided,&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Black. &ldquo;She
could do better than to buy that tumble-down old shack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she could; so she could,&rdquo; soothed the postmaster.
&ldquo;But it's going to be a good thing for the creditors, if she
can swing it. Let me see, you wa'n't a loser in the Bolton Bank; was
you, Mis' Black?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I wa'n't; my late departed husband had too much
horse-sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And having thus impugned less fortunate persons, Mrs. Solomon
Black departed, a little stiffer as to her back-bone than when she
entered. She had imparted information; she had also acquired it. When
she had returned rather later than usual from selling her
strawberries in Grenoble she had hurried her vegetables on to boil
and set the table for dinner. She could hear the minister pacing up
and down his room in the restless way which Mrs. Black secretly
resented, since it would necessitate changing the side breadths of
matting to the middle of the floor long before this should be done.
But of Lydia Orr there was no sign. The minister came promptly down
stairs at sound of the belated dinner-bell. But to Mrs. Black's
voluble explanations for the unwonted hour he returned the briefest
of perfunctory replies. He seemed hungry and ate heartily of the cold
boiled beef and vegetables.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see anything of <em>her</em> this morning?&rdquo;
asked Mrs. Black pointedly, as she cut the dried-apple pie. &ldquo;I
can't think what's become of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wesley Elliot glanced up from an absent-minded contemplation of an
egg spot on the tablecloth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you refer to Miss Orr,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I did see
her&mdash;in a carriage with Deacon Whittle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was instantly ashamed of the innocent prevarication. But he
told himself he did not choose to discuss Miss Orr's affairs with
Mrs. Black.</p>

<p>Just then Lydia came in, her eyes shining, her cheeks very pink;
but like the minister she seemed disposed to silence, and Mrs. Black
was forced to restrain her curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How'd you make out this morning?&rdquo; she inquired, as
Lydia, having hurried through her dinner, rose to leave the
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, thank you, Mrs. Black,&rdquo; said the girl
brightly. Then she went at once to her room and closed the door.</p>

<p>At supper time it was just the same; neither the minister nor the
girl who sat opposite him had anything to say. But no sooner had Mrs.
Black begun to clear away the dishes than the two withdrew to the
vine-shaded porch, as if by common consent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She ought to know right off about Fanny Dodge and the
minister,&rdquo; Mrs. Black told herself.</p>

<p>She was still revolving this in her mind as she walked sedately
along the street, the red and yellow striped bag clasped tightly in
both hands. Of course everybody in the village would suppose she knew
all about Lydia Orr. But the fact was she knew very little. The week
before, one of her customers in Grenoble, in the course of a business
transaction which involved a pair of chickens, a dozen eggs and two
boxes of strawberries, had asked, in a casual way, if Mrs. Black knew
any one in Brookville who kept boarders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The minister of our church boards with me,&rdquo; she told
the Grenoble woman, with pardonable pride. &ldquo;I don't know of
anybody else that takes boarders in Brookville.&rdquo;  She added
that she had an extra room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, one of my boarders&mdash;a real nice young lady from
Boston&mdash;has taken a queer notion to board in Brookville,&rdquo;
said the woman. &ldquo;She was out autoing the other day and went
through there. I guess the country 'round Brookville must be real
pretty this time of year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; it is, real pretty,&rdquo; she had told the Grenoble
woman.</p>

<p>And this had been the simple prelude to Lydia Orr's appearance in
Brookville.</p>

<p>Wooded hills did not interest Mrs. Black, nor did the meandering
of the silver river through its narrow valley. But she took an honest
pride in her own freshly painted white house with its vividly green
blinds, and in her front yard with its prim rows of annuals and
thrifty young dahlias. As for Miss Lydia Orr's girlish rapture over
the view from her bedroom window, so long as it was productive of
honestly earned dollars, Mrs. Black was disposed to view it with
indulgence. There was nothing about the girl or her possessions to
indicate wealth or social importance, beyond the fact that she
arrived in a hired automobile from Grenoble instead of riding over in
Mrs. Solomon Black's spring wagon. Miss Orr brought with her to
Brookville one trunk, the contents of which she had arranged at once
in the bureau drawers and wardrobe of Mrs. Black's second-best
bedroom. It was evident from a private inspection of their contents
that Miss Orr was in mourning.</p>

<p>At this point in her meditations Mrs. Black became aware of an
insistent voice hailing her from the other side of the picket
fence.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Daggett, her large fair face flushed with the exertion
of hurrying down the walk leading from Mrs. Whittle's house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of us ladies has been clearing up after the
fair,&rdquo; she explained, as she joined Mrs. Solomon Black.
&ldquo;It didn't seem no more than right; for even if Ann Whittle
doesn't use her parlor, on account of not having it furnished up, she
wants it broom-clean. My! You'd ought to have seen the muss we swept
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd have been glad to help,&rdquo; said Mrs. Black stiffly;
&ldquo;but what with it being my day to go over to Grenoble, and my
boarders t' cook for and all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we didn't expect you,&rdquo; said Abby Daggett
tranquilly. &ldquo;There was enough of us to do
everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She beamed warmly upon Mrs. Black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Us ladies was saying we'd all better give you a rising vote
of thanks for bringing that sweet Miss Orr to the fair. Why, 'twas a
real success after all; we took in two hundred and forty-seven
dollars and twenty-nine cents. Ain't that splendid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Black nodded. She felt suddenly proud of her share in this
success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess she wouldn't have come to the fair if I hadn't told
her about it,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;She only come to my house
yesterd'y morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In an auto?&rdquo; inquired Abby Daggett eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded Mrs. Black. &ldquo;I told her I could
bring her over in the wagon just as well as not; but she said she had
the man all engaged. I told her we was going to have a fair, and she
said right off she wanted to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abby Daggett laid her warm plump hand on Mrs. Black's arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno when I've took such a fancy to anybody at first
sight,&rdquo; she said musingly. &ldquo;She's what I call a real
sweet girl. I'm just going to love her, I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gazed beseechingly at Mrs. Solomon Black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe you'll think it's just gossipy curiosity; but I
<em>would</em> like to know where that girl come from, and who her
folks was, and how she happened to come to Brookville. I s'pose you
know all about her; don't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Solomon Black coughed slightly. She was aware of the
distinction she had already acquired in the eyes of Brookville from
the mere fact of Lydia Orr's presence in her house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I do,&rdquo; she began cautiously, &ldquo;I don't know
as it's for me to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't fer pity's sake think I'm nosey,&rdquo; besought Abby
Daggett almost tearfully. &ldquo;You know I ain't that kind; but I
don't see how folks is going to help being interested in a sweet
pretty girl like Miss Orr, and her coming so unexpected. And you know
there's them that'll invent things that ain't true, if they don't
hear the facts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's from Boston,&rdquo; said Mrs. Solomon Black
grudgingly. &ldquo;You can tell Lois Daggett that much, if she's
getting anxious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett's large face crimsoned. She was one of those soft,
easily hurt persons whose blushes bring tears. She sniffed a little
and raised her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid you'd&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of course I ain't scared of you, Abby,&rdquo;
relented Mrs. Black. &ldquo;But I says to myself, &lsquo;I'm goin' to
let Lydia Orr stand on her two own feet in this town,&rsquo; I says.
She can say what she likes about herself, an' there won't be no lies
coming home to roost at <em>my</em> house. I guess you'd feel the
very same way if you was in my place, Abby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett glanced with childish admiration at the other woman's
magenta-tinted face under its jetty water-waves. Even Mrs. Black's
everyday hat was handsomer than her own Sunday-best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You always was so smart an' sensible, Phoebe,&rdquo; she
said mildly. &ldquo;I remember 'way back in school, when we was both
girls, you always could see through arithmetic problems right off,
when I couldn't for the life of me. I guess you're right about
letting her speak for herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Course I am!&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Black triumphantly.</p>

<p>She had extricated herself from a difficulty with flying colors.
She would still preserve her reputation for being a close-mouthed
woman who knew a lot more about everything than she chose to
tell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anybody can see she's wearing mournin',&rdquo; she added
benevolently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thought mebbe she had a black dress on because
they're stylish. She did look awful pretty in it, with her arms and
neck showing through. I like black myself; but mourning&mdash;that's
different. Poor young thing, I wonder who it was. Her father, mebbe,
or her mother. You didn't happen to hear her say, did you,
Phoebe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Solomon Black compressed her lips tightly. She paused at her
own gate with majestic dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I'll have to hurry right in, Abby,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;I have my bread to set.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Solomon Black had closed her gate behind her, noticing as she
did so that Wesley Elliot and Lydia Orr had disappeared from the
piazza where she had left them. She glanced at Mrs. Daggett,
lingering wistfully before the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodnight, Abby,&rdquo; said she firmly.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter VI</h4>

<p>Mrs. Maria Dodge sifted flour over her molding board preparatory
to transferring the sticky mass of newly made dough from the big
yellow mixing bowl to the board. More flour and a skillful twirl or
two of the lump and the process of kneading was begun. It continued
monotonously for the space of two minutes; then the motions became
gradually slower, finally coming to a full stop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My patience!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Dodge, slapping her dough
smartly. &ldquo;Fanny ought to be ready by now. They'll be
late&mdash;both of 'em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hurriedly crossed the kitchen to where, through a partly open
door, an uncarpeted stair could be seen winding upward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny!&rdquo; she called sharply. &ldquo;Fanny! ain't you
ready yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A quick step in the passage above, a subdued whistle, and her son
Jim came clattering down the stair. He glanced at his mother, a
slight pucker between his handsome brows. She returned the look with
one of fond maternal admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How nice you do look, Jim,&rdquo; said she, and smiled up
at her tall son. &ldquo;I always did like you in red, and that
necktie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim Dodge shrugged his shoulders with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't know about that tie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Kind of
crude and flashy, ain't it, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flashy? No, of course it ain't. It looks real stylish with
the brown suit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stylish,&rdquo; repeated the young man. &ldquo;Yes, I'm a
regular swell&mdash;everything up to date, latest Broadway
cut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked down with some bitterness at his stalwart young person
clad in clothes somewhat shabby, despite a recent pressing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dodge had returned to her bread which had spread in a mass of
stickiness all over the board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's Fanny?&rdquo; she asked, glancing up at the noisy
little clock on the shelf above her head. &ldquo;Tell her to hurry,
Jim. You're late, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim passed his hand thoughtfully over his clean-shaven chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might as well know, mother; Fan isn't going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not going?&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Dodge, sharp dismay in voice
and eyes. &ldquo;Why, I did up her white dress a-purpose, and she's
been making up ribbon bows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She extricated her fingers from the bread and again hurried across
the floor.</p>

<p>Her son intercepted her with a single long stride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use, mother,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Better let
her alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think it's&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man slammed the door leading to the stairway with a
fierce gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you weren't blinder than a bat, mother, you'd know by
this time what ailed Fan,&rdquo; he said angrily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dodge sank into a chair by the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I ain't blind,&rdquo; she denied weakly; &ldquo;but I
thought mebbe Fannie&mdash;I hoped&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you think she'd refused him?&rdquo; demanded Jim
roughly. &ldquo;Did you suppose&mdash;? Huh! makes me mad clean
through to think of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dodge began picking the dough off her fingers and rolling it
into little balls which she laid in a row on the edge of the
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've been awful worried about Fanny&mdash;ever since the
night of the fair,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;He was here all that
afternoon and stayed to tea; don't you remember? And they were just
as happy together&mdash;I guess I can tell! But he ain't been near
her since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused to wipe her eyes on a corner of her gingham apron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny thought&mdash;at least I sort of imagined Mr. Elliot
didn't like the way you treated him that night,&rdquo; she went on
piteously. &ldquo;You're kind of short in your ways, Jim, if you
don't like anybody; don't you know you are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man had thrust his hands deep in his trousers' pockets
and was glowering at the dough on the molding board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's rotten nonsense, mother,&rdquo; he burst out.
&ldquo;Do you suppose, if a man's really in love with a girl, he's
going to care a cotton hat about the way her brother treats him? You
don't know much about men if you think so. No; you're on the wrong
track. It wasn't my fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His mother's tragic dark eyes entreated him timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm awfully afraid Fanny's let herself get all wrapped up
in the minister,&rdquo; she half whispered. &ldquo;And if
he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd like to thrash him!&rdquo; interrupted her son in a low
tense voice. &ldquo;He's a white-livered, cowardly hypocrite, that's
my name for Wesley Elliot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Jim, that ain't goin' to help Fanny&mdash;what you
think of Mr. Elliot. And anyway, it ain't so. It's something else. Do
you&mdash;suppose, you could&mdash;You wouldn't like to&mdash;to
speak to him, Jim&mdash;would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! speak to that fellow about my sister? Why, mother,
you must be crazy! What could I say?&mdash;&lsquo;My sister Fanny is
in love with you; and I don't think you're treating her right.&rsquo;
 Is that your idea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Jim! Don't talk so loud. She might hear
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No danger of that, mother; she was lying on her bed, her
face in the pillow, when I looked in her room ten minutes ago. Said
she had a headache and wasn't going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dodge drew a deep, dispirited sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there was only something a body could do,&rdquo; she
began. &ldquo;You might get into conversation with him, kind of
careless, couldn't you, Jim? And then you might mention that he
hadn't been to see us for two weeks&mdash;'course you'd put it real
cautious, then perhaps he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A light hurried step on the stair warned them to silence; the door
was pushed open and Fanny Dodge entered the kitchen. She was wearing
the freshly ironed white dress, garnished with crisp pink ribbons;
her cheeks were brilliant with color, her pretty head poised
high.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I changed my mind,&rdquo; said she, in a hard, sweet voice.
&ldquo;I decided I'd go, after all. My&mdash;my head feels
better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mother and son exchanged stealthy glances behind the girl's back
as she leaned toward the cracked mirror between the windows,
apparently intent upon capturing an airy tendril of hair which had
escaped confinement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's real sensible, Fanny,&rdquo; approved Mrs. Dodge
with perfunctory cheerfulness. &ldquo;I want you should go out all
you can, whilest you're young, an' have a good time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim Dodge was silent; but the scowl between his eyes deepened.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dodge formed three words with her lips, as she shook her head
at him warningly.</p>

<p>Fanny burst into a sudden ringing laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can see you in the glass, mother,&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;I don't care what Jim says to me; he can say anything he
likes.&rdquo;</p>

alt="[Illustration: &ldquo;Oh, I can see you in the glass,
mother,&rdquo; she cried.]">

<p>Her beautiful face, half turned over her shoulder, quivered
slightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you knew how I&mdash;&rdquo; she began, then stopped
short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's just what I was saying to Jim,&rdquo; put in her
mother eagerly.</p>

<p>The girl flung up both hands in a gesture of angry protest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don't talk about me, mother&mdash;to Jim, or
anybody. Do you hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice shrilled suddenly loud and harsh, like an untuned string
under the bow.</p>

<p>Jim Dodge flung his hat on his head with an impatient
exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Fan,&rdquo; he said roughly. &ldquo;Nobody's going
to bother you. Don't you worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dodge had gone back to her kneading board and was thumping
the dough with regular slapping motions of her capable hands, but her
thin dark face was drawn into a myriad folds and puckers of
anxiety.</p>

<p>Fanny stooped and brushed the lined forehead with her fresh young
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodnight, mother,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I wish you were
going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew back a little and looked down at her mother, smiling
brilliantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don't you worry another minute about me, mother,&rdquo;
she said resolutely. &ldquo;I'm all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do hope so, child,&rdquo; returned her mother,
sniffing back her ready tears. &ldquo;I'd hate to feel that
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl hurried to the door, where her brother stood watching
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Jim,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We have to stop for
Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She followed him down the narrow path to the gate, holding her
crisp white skirts well away from the dew-drenched border. As the two
emerged upon the road, lying white before them under the brilliant
moonlight, Fanny glanced up timidly at her brother's dimly seen
profile under the downward sweep of his hat-brim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's real dusty, isn't it?&rdquo; said she, by way of
breaking a silence she found unbearable. &ldquo;It'll make my shoes
look horrid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk over on the side more,&rdquo; advised Jim
laconically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I'll get in with all those weeds; they're covered with
dust and wet, besides,&rdquo; objected Fanny.... &ldquo;Say,
Jim!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn't it be nice if we had an auto, then I could step
in, right in front of the house, and keep as clean
as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn't you like an a&euml;roplane better, Fan? I believe
I would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could keep it in the barn; couldn't you,
Jim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; derided Jim, &ldquo;the barn isn't what you'd
call up-to-date. I require a hangar&mdash;or whatever you call
'em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl smothered a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we weren't so poor&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;lots of things.... They say that Orr girl has
heaps of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who says so?&rdquo; demanded her brother roughly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, everybody. Joyce Fulsom told me her father said so;
and he ought to know. Do you suppose&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I suppose what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim's tone was almost savage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's the matter with you, Jim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny's sweet voice conveyed impatience, almost reproach. It was
as if she had said to her brother, &ldquo;You know how I must feel,
and yet you are cross with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim glanced down at her, sudden relenting in his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking it's pretty hard lines for both of
us,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If we were rich and could come speeding
into town in a snappy auto, our clothes in the latest style, I guess
things would be different. There's no use talking, Fan; there's
mighty little chance for our sort. And if there's one thing I hate
more than another it's what folks call sympathy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; cried Fanny. &ldquo;I simply can't bear it
to know that people are saying behind my back, &lsquo;There's
<em>poor</em> Fanny Dodge; I wonder&mdash;&rsquo;  Then they squeeze
your hand, and gaze at you and sigh. Even mother&mdash;I want you to
tell mother I'm not&mdash;that it isn't true&mdash;I can't talk to
her, Jim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll put her wise,&rdquo; said Jim gruffly.</p>

<p>After a pause, during which both walked faster than before, he
said hurriedly, as if the words broke loose:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you give that fellow another thought, Fan. He isn't
worth it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl started like a blooded horse under the whip. She did not
pretend to misunderstand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you never liked him, Jim,&rdquo; she said after a
short silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet I didn't! Forget him, Fan. That's all I have to
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;if I only knew what it was&mdash;I must have done
something&mdash;said something&mdash; I keep wondering and wondering.
I can't help it, Jim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an irrepressible sob in the girl's voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Fan, pull yourself together,&rdquo; he urged.
&ldquo;Here's Ellen waiting for us by the gate. Don't for heaven's
sake give yourself away. Keep a stiff upper lip, old girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought you two were never coming!&rdquo; Ellen's
full rich voice floated out to them, as they came abreast of the Dix
homestead nestled back among tall locust trees.</p>

<p>The girl herself daintily picked her way toward them among the
weeds by the roadside. She uttered a little cry of dismay as a stray
branch caught in her muslin skirts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's the sign of a beau, Ellen,&rdquo; laughed Fanny,
with extravagant gayety. &ldquo;The bigger the stick the handsomer
and richer the beau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made you so late?&rdquo; inquired Ellen, as all three
proceeded on their way, the two girls linked affectionately arm in
arm; Jim Dodge striding in the middle of the road a little apart from
his companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; fibbed Fanny. &ldquo;I guess I was
slow starting to dress. The days are so long now I didn't realize how
late it was getting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen glanced sympathizingly at her friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid you wouldn't want to come, Fanny,&rdquo; she
murmured, &ldquo;Seeing the social is at Mrs. Solomon Black's
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn't I want to come?&rdquo; demanded Fanny
aggressively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn't know,&rdquo; replied Ellen.</p>

<p>After a pause she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Orr girl has really bought the Bolton house; I suppose
you heard? It's all settled; and she's going to begin fixing up the
place right off. Don't you think it's funny for a girl like her to
want a house all to herself. I should think she'd rather board, as
long as she's single.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't know about that,&rdquo; said Jim Dodge
coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You folks'll get money out of it; so shall we,&rdquo; Ellen
went on. &ldquo;Everybody's so excited! I went down for the mail this
afternoon and seemed to me 'most everybody was out in the street
talking it over. My! I'd hate to be her tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Fanny shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't know. Everybody will be crowding around, asking
questions and saying things.... Do you think she's pretty,
Jim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty?&rdquo; echoed the young man.</p>

<p>He shot a keen glance at Ellen Dix from under half-closed lids.
The girl's big, black eyes were fixed full upon him; she was leaning
forward, a suggestion of timid defiance in the poise of her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that depends,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;No, I
don't think she's <em>pretty</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen burst into a sudden trill of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I supposed all
the men&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do think she's beautiful,&rdquo; he finished calmly.
&ldquo;There's a difference, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen Dix tossed her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is there?&rdquo; she said airily. &ldquo;Well, I don't
even think she's pretty; do you, Fan?&mdash;with all that light hair,
drawn back plain from her forehead, and those big, solemn eyes. But I
guess she <em>thinks</em> she's pretty, all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She doesn't think anything about herself,&rdquo; said Jim
doggedly. &ldquo;She isn't that kind of a girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen Dix bit a vexed exclamation short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't believe any of us know her very well,&rdquo; she
said, after a pause. &ldquo;You know what a gossip Lois Daggett is?
Well, I met her and Mrs. Fulsom and Mrs. Whittle coming out of the
Daggetts' house. They'd been talking it over; when they saw me they
stopped me to ask if I'd been to see Miss Orr, and when I said no,
not yet, but I was going, Lois Daggett said, &lsquo;Well, I do hope
she won't be quite so close-mouthed with you girls. When I asked her,
real sympathizing, who she was wearing black for, she said she had
lost a dear friend and never even told who it was!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim Dodge threw back his head and burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Served her right,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean Lois?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn't suppose I meant Miss Orr; did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim's voice held a disdainful note which brought the hot color to
Ellen's cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm not so stupid as you seem to think, Jim Dodge,&rdquo;
she said, with spirit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought you were stupid, Ellen,&rdquo; he returned
quickly. &ldquo;Don't make a mistake and be so now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen gazed at him in hurt silence. She guessed at his meaning and
it humiliated her girlish pride.</p>

<p>It was Fanny who said somewhat impatiently: &ldquo;I'm sure I
can't think what you mean, Jim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, in my humble opinion, it would be downright stupid
for you two girls to fool yourselves into disliking Lydia Orr. She'd
like to be friends with everybody; why not give her a
chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Ellen did not reply; and again it was Fanny who spoke the
words that rose to her friend's lips unuttered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can't see how you should know so much about Miss Orr,
Jim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't myself,&rdquo; he returned good-humoredly.
&ldquo;But sometimes a man can see through a woman better&mdash;or at
least more fair-mindedly than another woman. You see,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;there's no sex jealousy in the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both girls cried out in protest against this.</p>

<p>It wasn't so, they declared. He ought to be ashamed of himself! As
for being <em>jealous</em> of any one&mdash;Fanny haughtily
disclaimed the suggestion, with a bitterness which astonished her
friend.</p>

<p>It was something of a relief to all three when the brilliantly
illuminated house and grounds belonging to Mrs. Solomon Black came in
view. Japanese lanterns in lavish abundance had been strung from tree
to tree and outlined the piazza and the walk leading to the
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn't it look lovely!&rdquo; cried Ellen, scattering her
vexation to the winds. &ldquo;I never saw anything so
pretty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inside the house further surprises awaited them; the music of harp
and violins stole pleasantly through the flower-scented rooms, which
were softly lighted with shaded lamps the like of which Brookville
had never seen before.</p>

<p>Mrs. Solomon Black, arrayed in a crisp blue taffeta, came bustling
to meet them. But not before Fanny's swift gaze had penetrated the
assembled guests. Yes! there was Wesley Elliot's tall figure. He was
talking to Mrs. Henry Daggett at the far end of the double
parlors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go right up stairs and lay off your things,&rdquo; urged
their hostess hospitably. &ldquo;Ladies to the right; gents to the
left. I'm so glad you came, Fanny. I'd begun to
wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl's lip curled haughtily. The slight emphasis on the
personal pronoun and the fervid squeeze of Mrs. Black's fat hand hurt
her sore heart. But she smiled brilliantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Black, I wouldn't have missed it for
worlds!&rdquo; she said coldly.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter VII</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Does my hair look decent?&rdquo; asked Ellen, as the two
girls peered into the mirror together. &ldquo;The dew does take the
curl out so. It must be lovely to have naturally curly hair, like
yours, Fanny. It looks all the prettier for being damp and ruffled
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny was pulling out the fluffy masses of curling brown hair
about her forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your hair looks all right, Ellen,&rdquo; she said
absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>She was wondering if Wesley Elliot would speak to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw that Orr girl,&rdquo; whispered Ellen; &ldquo;she's
got on a white dress, all lace, and a black sash. She does look
pretty, Fanny; we'll have to acknowledge it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; murmured Fanny who was drawing on a pair of
fresh white gloves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You aren't going to wear those gloves down stairs, are you,
Fan? I haven't got any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My hands are all stained up with currant jelly,&rdquo;
explained Fanny hurriedly. &ldquo;Your hands are real pretty,
Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen glanced down at her capable, brown hands, with their blunt
finger-tips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever notice <em>her</em> hands, Fanny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her nails are cut kind of pointed, and all shined up. And
her hands are so little and soft and white. I suppose a man&mdash;do
you think Jim would notice that sort of thing, Fanny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny snapped the fastenings of her gloves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let's go down stairs,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;They'll
be wondering what's become of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Fan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen Dix caught at her friend's arm, her pretty face, with its
full pouting lips and brilliant dark eyes upturned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose&mdash; You don't think Jim is mad at me for
what I said about <em>her</em>, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't remember you said anything to make anybody mad.
Come, let's go down, Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Fan, I was wondering if that girl&mdash; Do you know
I&mdash;I kind of wish she hadn't come to Brookville. Everything
seems&mdash;different, already. Don't you think so, Fanny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't know. Why should you think about it? She's here
and there's no use. I'm going down, Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny moved toward the stairs, her fresh young beauty heightened
by an air of dignified reserve which Ellen Dix had failed to
penetrate.</p>

<p>Wesley Elliot, who had by now reached the wide opening into the
hall in the course of his progress among the guests, glanced up as
Fanny Dodge swept the last step of the stair with her unfashionable
white gown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, good evening, Miss Dodge,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with
commendable presence of mind, seeing the heart under his waistcoat
had executed an uncomfortable <i>pas seul</i> at sight of her.</p>

<p>He held out his hand with every appearance of cordial welcome, and
after an instant's hesitation Fanny laid her gloved fingers in it.
She had meant to avoid his direct gaze, but somehow his glance had
caught and held her own. What were his eyes saying to her? She
blushed and trembled under the soft dark fire of them. In that
instant she appeared so wholly adorable, so temptingly sweet that the
young man felt his prudent resolves slipping away from him one by
one. Had they been alone&mdash;...</p>

<p>But, no; Ellen Dix, her piquant, provokingly pretty face
tip-tilted with ardent curiosity, was just behind. In another moment
he was saying, in the easy, pleasant way everybody liked, that he was
glad to see Ellen; and how was Mrs. Dix, this evening? And why wasn't
she there?</p>

<p>Ellen replied demurely that it had been given out on Sunday as a
young people's social; so her mother thought she wasn't included.</p>

<p>They entered the crowded room, where Deacon Whittle was presently
heard declaring that he felt just as young as anybody, so he
&ldquo;picked up mother and came right along with Joe.&rdquo;  And
Mrs. Daggett, whose placid face had lighted with pleasure at sight of
Fanny and Ellen, proclaimed that when the day came for <em>her</em>
to stay at home from a young folks' social she hoped they'd bury her,
right off.</p>

<p>So the instant&mdash;psychological or otherwise&mdash;passed. But
Fanny Dodge's heavy heart was beating hopefully once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could only see him alone,&rdquo; she was thinking.
&ldquo;He would explain everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her thoughts flew onward to the moment when she would come down
stairs once more, cloaked for departure. Perhaps Wesley&mdash;she
ventured to call him Wesley in her joyously confused
thoughts&mdash;perhaps Wesley would walk home with her as on other
occasions not long past. Jim, she reflected, could go with Ellen.</p>

<p>Then all at once she came upon Lydia Orr, in her simple white
dress, made with an elegant simplicity which convicted every girl in
the room of dowdiness. She was talking with Judge Fulsom, who was
slowly consuming a huge saucer of ice-cream, with every appearance of
enjoyment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I understand it, my dear young lady, you wish to employ
Brookville talent exclusively in repairing your house,&rdquo; Fanny
heard him saying, between smacking mouthfuls.</p>

<p>And Lydia Orr replied, &ldquo;Yes, if you please, I do want
everything to be done here. There are people who can, aren't
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she saw that Fanny had paused and was gazing at her
doubtfully, her hand went out with a smile, wistful and timid and
sincere, all at once. There was something so appealing in the girl's
upturned face, an honesty of purpose so crystal-clear in her lovely
eyes, that Fanny, still confused and uncertain whether to be happy or
not, was irresistibly drawn to her. She thought for a fleeting
instant she would like to take Lydia Orr away to some dim secluded
spot and there pour out her heart. The next minute she was ready to
laugh at herself for entertaining so absurd an idea. She glanced down
at Lydia's ungloved hands, which Ellen Dix had just described, and
reflected soberly that Wesley Elliot sat at table with those dainty
pink-tipped fingers three times each day. She had not answered
Ellen's foolish little questions; but now she felt sure that any man,
possessed of his normal faculties, could hardly fail to become aware
of Lydia Orr's delicate beauty.</p>

<p>Fanny compelled herself to gaze with unprejudiced eyes at the fair
transparent skin, with the warm color coming and going beneath it, at
the masses of blond hair drawn softly back from the high round
forehead, at the large blue eyes beneath the long sweep of darker
lashes, at the exquisite curve of the lips and the firmly modeled
chin. Yes; Jim had seen truly; the ordinary adjective
&ldquo;pretty&rdquo;&mdash;applicable alike to a length of ribbon, a
gown, or a girl of the commoner type&mdash;could not be applied to
Lydia Orr. She was beautiful to the discerning eye, and Fanny
unwillingly admitted it.</p>

<p>Lydia Orr, unabashed by the girl's frank inspection, returned her
gaze with beaming friendliness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know I'd bought a house?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;It's old and needs a lot of repairing; so I was just asking
Judge Fulsom&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deacon Amos Whittle is, so to say, a contractor,&rdquo;
said the Judge ponderously, &ldquo;and so, in a way, am I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A contractor?&rdquo; puzzled Lydia. &ldquo;Yes; but
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you'll just give over everything into our hands
connected with putting the old place into A-number-one shape, I think
you'll find you can dismiss the whole matter from your mind. In two
months' time, my dear young lady, we'll guarantee to pass the house
over to you in apple-pie order, good as new, if not better.... Yes,
indeed; better!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Judge eyed his empty saucer regretfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's the best ice cream&mdash;&rdquo; he added with total
irrelevance. &ldquo;Have some, won't you? I hear they're passing it
out free and permiscuous in the back room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we should like some cream, if you please, Judge
Fulsom,&rdquo; said Lydia, &ldquo;if you'll keep us
company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I'll keep company with you, as far as strawberry ice
cream's concerned,&rdquo; chuckled the Judge, his big bulk shaking
with humor. &ldquo;But I see Mis' Fulsom over there; she's got her
weather eye on us. Now, watch me skeedaddle for that cream! Pink,
white or brown, Miss Orr; or, all three mixed? There's a young fellow
out there in charge of the freezers that sure is a wonder. How about
you, Fanny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls looked at each other with a smile of understanding
as the big figure of the Judge moved ponderously away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We never had ice cream before at a church sociable,&rdquo;
said Fanny. &ldquo;And I didn't know Mrs. Solomon Black had so many
lanterns. Did you buy all this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her gesture seemed to include the shaded lamps, the masses of
flowers and trailing vines, the gay strains of music, and the
plentiful refreshments which nearly every one was enjoying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's just like a regular party,&rdquo; she added.
&ldquo;We're not used to such things in Brookville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; Lydia asked, doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; returned Fanny, the color rising
swiftly to her face.</p>

<p>She had caught a glimpse of Wesley Elliot edging his way past a
group of the younger boys and girls, mad with the revelry of
unlimited cake and ice cream. He was coming directly toward their
corner; his eyes, alas! fixed upon the stranger in their midst.
Unconsciously Fanny sighed deeply; the corners of her smiling lips
drooped. She appeared all at once like a lovely rose which some one
has worn for an hour and cast aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's such a little thing to do,&rdquo; murmured Lydia.</p>

<p>Then, before Fanny was aware of her intention, she had slipped
away. At the same moment Judge Fulsom made his appearance, elbowing
his smiling way through the crowd, a brimming saucer of vari-colored
ice cream in each hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; he announced cheerfully. &ldquo;Had to
get a <i>habeas corpus</i> on this ice cream, though. Why, what's
become of Miss Orr? Gone with a handsomer man&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared humorously at the minister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twa'n't you, dominie; seen' you're here. Had any ice cream
yet? No harm done, if you have. Seems to be a plenty. Take this,
parson, and I'll replevin another plate for myself and one for Miss
Orr. Won't be gone more'n another hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny, piteously tongue-tied in the presence of the man she loved,
glanced up at Wesley Elliot with a timidity she had never before felt
in his company. His eyes under close-drawn brows were searching the
crowd. Fanny divined that she was not in his thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are looking for Miss Orr,&rdquo; she said
distinctly, &ldquo;I think she has gone out in the kitchen. I saw
Mrs. Solomon Black beckon to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The minister glanced down at her; his rash impulse of an hour back
was already forgotten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you think it's awfully warm in here?&rdquo; continued
Fanny.</p>

<p>A sudden desperate desire had assailed her; she must&mdash;she
would compel him to some sort of an explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a warm evening,&rdquo; commented the minister.
&ldquo;But why not eat your cream? You'll find it will cool you
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don't care much for ice cream,&rdquo; said Fanny,
in a low tremulous voice.</p>

<p>She gazed at him, her dark eyes brimming with eager questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was wondering if we couldn't&mdash;it's pleasant out in
the yard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you'll excuse me for just a moment, Miss Dodge,&rdquo;
Wesley Elliot's tone was blandly courteous&mdash;&ldquo;I'll try and
find you a chair. They appear to be scarce articles; I believe the
ladies removed most of them to the rear of the house. Pardon
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He set down his plate of ice cream on the top shelf of Mrs.
Solomon Black's what-not, thereby deranging a careful group of
sea-shells and daguerreotypes, and walked quickly away.</p>

<p>Fanny's face flushed to a painful crimson; then as suddenly paled.
She was a proud girl, accustomed to love and admiration since early
childhood, when she had queened it over her playmates because her
yellow curls were longer than theirs, her cheeks pinker, her eyes
brighter and her slim, strong body taller. Fanny had never been
compelled to stoop from her graceful height to secure masculine
attention. It had been hers by a sort of divine right. She had not
been at all surprised when the handsome young minister had looked at
her twice, thrice, to every other girl's once, nor when he had
singled her out from the others in the various social events of the
country side.</p>

<p>Fanny had long ago resolved, in the secret of her own heart, that
she would never, never become the hard-worked wife of a plodding
farmer. Somewhere in the world&mdash;riding toward her on the steed
of his passionate desire&mdash;was the fairy prince; her prince,
coming to lift her out from the sordid commonplace of life in
Brookville. Almost from the very first she had recognized Wesley
Elliot as her deliverer.</p>

<p>Once he had said to her: &ldquo;I have a strange feeling that I
have known you always.&rdquo;  She had cherished the saying in her
heart, hoping&mdash;believing that it might, in some vague,
mysterious way, be true. And not at all aware that this pretty
sentiment is as old as the race and the merest banality on the
masculine tongue, signifying: &ldquo;At this moment I am drawn to
you, as to no other woman; but an hour hence it may be
otherwise.&rdquo; ... How else may man, as yet imperfectly
monogamous, find the mate for whom he is ever ardently questing? In
this woman he finds the trick of a lifted lash, or a shadowy dimple
in the melting rose of her cheek. In another, the stately curve of
neck and shoulder and the somber fire of dark eyes draws his roving
gaze; in a third, there is a soft, adorable prettiness, like that of
a baby. He has always known them&mdash;all. And thus it is, that love
comes and goes unbidden, like the wind which blows where it listeth;
and woman, hearing the sound thereof, cannot tell whence it cometh
nor whither it goeth.</p>

<p>In this particular instance Wesley Elliot had not chosen to
examine the secret movements of his own mind. Baldly speaking, he had
cherished a fleeting fancy for Fanny Dodge, a sort of love in
idleness, which comes to a man like the delicate, floating seeds of
the parasite orchid, capable indeed of exquisite blossoming; but
deadly to the tree upon which it fastens. He had resolved to free
himself. It was a sensible resolve. He was glad he had made up his
mind to it before it was too late. Upon the possible discomfiture of
Fanny Dodge he bestowed but a single thought: She would get over it.
&ldquo;It&rdquo; meaning a quite pardonable fancy&mdash;he refused to
give it a more specific name&mdash;for himself. To the unvoiced
opinions of Mrs. Solomon Black, Mrs. Deacon Whittle, Ellen Dix, Mrs.
Abby Daggett and all the other women of his parish he was wholly
indifferent. Men, he was glad to remember, never bothered their heads
about another man's love affairs....</p>

<p>The chairs from the sitting room had been removed to the yard,
where they were grouped about small tables adequately illuminated by
the moon and numerous Japanese lanterns. Every second chair appeared
to be filled by a giggling, pink-cheeked girl; the others being
suitably occupied by youths of the opposite sex&mdash;all pleasantly
occupied. The minister conscientiously searched for the chair he had
promised to fetch to Fanny Dodge; but it never once occurred to him
to bring Fanny out to the cool loveliness of mingled moon and
lantern-light. There was no unoccupied chair, as he quickly
discovered; but he came presently upon Lydia Orr, apparently doing
nothing at all. She was standing near Mrs. Black's boundary picket
fence, shielded from the observation of the joyous groups about the
little tables by the down-dropping branches of an apple-tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was looking for you!&rdquo; said Wesley Elliot.</p>

<p>It was the truth; but it surprised him nevertheless. He supposed
he had been looking for a chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you?&rdquo; said Lydia, smiling.</p>

<p>She moved a little away from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go in,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why must you? It's delightful out here&mdash;so cool
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. But the others&mdash; Why not bring Miss Dodge
out of that hot room? I thought she looked tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't notice,&rdquo; he said.... &ldquo;Just look at
that flock of little white clouds up there with the moon shining
through them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia glided away over the soft grass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've been looking at them for a long time,&rdquo; she said
gently. &ldquo;I must go now and help cut more cake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made a gesture of disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They're fairly stuffing,&rdquo; he complained. &ldquo;And,
anyway, there are plenty of women to attend to all that. I want to
talk to you, Miss Orr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His tone was authoritative.</p>

<p>She turned her head and looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To talk to me?&rdquo; she echoed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; come back&mdash;for just a minute. I know what you're
thinking: that it's my duty to be talking to parishioners. Well, I've
been doing that all the evening. I think I'm entitled to a moment of
relaxation; don't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm a parishioner,&rdquo; she reminded him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are,&rdquo; he agreed joyously. &ldquo;And I haven't
had a word with you this evening, so far; so you see it's my duty to
talk to you; and it's your duty to listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

<p>Her face upturned to his in the moonlight wore the austere
loveliness of a saint's.</p>

<img src="images/ab2.jpg" width="712" height="1100"
alt="[Illustration: Her face upturned to his in the moonlight, wore
the austere loveliness of a saint's.]">

<p>&ldquo;I wish you'd tell me something,&rdquo; he said, his fine
dark eyes taking in every detail of delicate tint and outline.
&ldquo;Do you know it all seems very strange and unusual to
me&mdash;your coming to Brookville the way you did, and doing so much
to&mdash;to make the people here happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew a deep, sighing breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm afraid it isn't going to be easy,&rdquo; she said
slowly. &ldquo;I thought it would be; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you came with that intention,&rdquo; he inferred
quickly. &ldquo;You meant to do it from the beginning. But just what
was the beginning? What ever attracted your attention to this forlorn
little place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, her eyes downcast. Then she
smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might ask you the same question,&rdquo; she said at last.
&ldquo;Why did you come to Brookville, Mr. Elliot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is easily explained. I had a call to
Brookville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Yes; I think that was
the reason&mdash;if there must be a reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is always a reason for everything,&rdquo; he urged.
&ldquo;But you didn't understand me. Do you know I couldn't say this
to another soul in Brookville; but I'm going to tell you: I wanted to
live and work in a big city, and I tried to find a
church&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I know,&rdquo; she said, unexpectedly. &ldquo;One
can't always go where one wishes to go, just at first. Things turn
out that way, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They seemed to want me here in Brookville,&rdquo; he said,
with some bitterness. &ldquo;It was a last resort, for me. I might
have taken a position in a school; but I couldn't bring myself to
that. I'd dreamed of preaching&mdash;to big audiences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled at him, with a gentle sidewise motion of the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God lets us do things, if we want to hard enough,&rdquo;
she told him quite simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you believe that?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Perhaps you'll
think it strange for me to ask; but do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great wave of emotion seemed to pass over her quiet face. He saw
it alter strangely under his gaze. For an instant she stood
transfigured; smiling, without word or movement. Then the inward
light subsided. She was only an ordinary young woman, once more, upon
whom one might bestow an indulgent smile&mdash;so simple, even
childlike she was, in her unaffected modesty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really must go in,&rdquo; she said apologetically,
&ldquo;and help them cut the cake.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter VIII</h4>

<p>Jim Dodge had been hoeing potatoes all day. It was hard,
monotonous work, and he secretly detested it. But the hunting season
was far away, and the growing potatoes were grievously beset by
weeds; so he had cut and thrust with his sharp-bladed hoe from early
morning till the sun burned the crest of the great high-shouldered
hill which appeared to close in the valley like a rampart, off
Grenoble way. As a matter of fact, the brawling stream which gave
Brookville its name successfully skirted the hill by a narrow margin
which likewise afforded space for the state road.</p>

<p>But the young man was not considering either the geographical
contours of the country at large or the refreshed and renovated
potato field, with its serried ranks of low-growing plants, as he
tramped heavily crosslots toward the house. At noon, when he came in
to dinner, in response to the wideflung summons of the tin horn which
hung by the back door, he had found the two women of his household in
a pleasurable state of excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We've got our share, Jim!&rdquo; proclaimed Mrs. Dodge, a
bright red spot glowing on either thin cheek. &ldquo;See! here's the
check; it came in the mail this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she spread a crackling bit of paper under her son's eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was some surprised to get it so soon,&rdquo; she added.
&ldquo;Folks ain't generally in any great hurry to part with their
money. But they do say Miss Orr paid right down for the
place&mdash;never even asked 'em for any sort of terms; and th' land
knows they'd have been glad to given them to her, or to anybody that
had bought the place these dozen years back. Likely she didn't know
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim scowled at the check.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much did she pay for the place?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;It must have been a lot more than it was worth, judging from
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; Mrs. Dodge replied. &ldquo;And I dunno
as I care particularly, as long's we've got our share of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was swaying back and forth in a squeaky old rocking-chair, the
check clasped in both thin hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we bank it, children; or draw it all out in cash?
Fanny needs new clothes; so do you, Jim. And I've got to have a new
carpet, or something, for the parlor. Those skins of wild animals you
brought in are all right, Jim, if one can't get anything better. I
suppose we'd ought to be prudent and saving; but I declare we haven't
had any money to speak of, for so long&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dodge's faded eyes were glowing with joy; she spread the
check upon her lap and gazed at it smilingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I declare it's the biggest surprise I've had in all my
life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let's spend every cent of it,&rdquo; proposed Fanny
recklessly. &ldquo;We didn't know we were going to have it. We can
scrub along afterward the same as we always have. Let's divide it
into four parts: one for the house&mdash;to fix it up&mdash;and one
for each of us, to spend any way we like. What do you say,
Jim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn't wonder if Mrs. Deacon Whittle would furnish up
her best parlor something elegant,&rdquo; surmised Mrs. Dodge.
&ldquo;She's always said she was goin' to have gilt paper and marble
tops and electric blue plush upholstered furniture. I guess that'll
be the last fair we'll ever have in that house. She wouldn't have
everybody trampin' over her flowered Body-Brussels. I suppose
<em>we</em> might buy some plush furniture; but I don't know as I'd
care for electric blue. What do you think, son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim Dodge sat sprawled out in his chair before the half-set table.
At this picture of magnificence, about to be realized in the abode of
Deacon Amos Whittle, he gave vent to an inarticulate growl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's the matter with you, Jim?&rdquo; shrilled his
mother, whose perpetually jangled nerves were capable of strange
dissonances. &ldquo;Anybody'd suppose you wasn't pleased at having
the old Bolton place sold at last, and a little bit of all that's
been owing to us since before your poor father died, paid off. My! If
we was to have all that was coming to us by rights, with the interest
money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm hungry and tired, mother, and I want my dinner,&rdquo;
said Jim brusquely. &ldquo;That check won't hoe the potatoes; so I
guess I'll have to do it, same as usual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For pity sake, Fanny!&rdquo; cried his mother, &ldquo;did
you put the vegetables over to boil? I ain't thought of anything
since this check came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It appeared that Fanny had been less forgetful.</p>

<p>After his belated dinner, Jim had gone back to his potatoes,
leaving his mother and sister deep in discussion over the comparative
virtues of Nottingham lace and plain muslin, made up with ruffles,
for parlor curtains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really believe I'd rather spend more on the house than on
clo'es at my age,&rdquo; he heard his mother saying, happily, as he
strode away.</p>

<p>All during the afternoon, to the clink of myriad small stones
against the busy blade of his hoe, Jim thought about Lydia Orr. He
could not help seeing that it was to Lydia he owed the prospect of a
much needed suit of clothes. It would be Lydia who hung curtains, of
whatever sort, in their shabby best room. And no other than Lydia was
to furnish Mrs. Whittle's empty parlor. She had already given the
minister a new long-tailed coat, as Jim chose to characterize the
ministerial black. His cheeks burned under the slanting rays of the
afternoon sun with something deeper than an added coat of tan. Why
should Lydia Orr&mdash;that slip of a girl, with the eyes of a baby,
or a saint&mdash;do all this? Jim found himself unable to believe
that she really wanted the Bolton place. Why, the house was an
uninhabitable ruin! It would cost thousands of dollars to rebuild
it.</p>

<p>He set his jaw savagely as he recalled his late conversation with
Deacon Whittle. &ldquo;The cheating old skinflint,&rdquo; as he
mentally termed that worthy pillar of the church, had, he was sure,
bamboozled the girl into buying a well-nigh worthless property, at a
scandalous price. It was a shame! He, Jim Dodge, even now burned with
the shame of it. He pondered briefly the possibilities of taking from
his mother the check, which represented the <i>pro rata</i> share of
the Dodge estate, and returning it to Lydia Orr. Reluctantly he
abandoned this quixotic scheme. The swindle&mdash;for as such he
chose to view it&mdash;had already been accomplished. Other people
would not return their checks. On the contrary, there would be new
and fertile schemes set on foot to part the unworldly stranger and
her money.</p>

<p>He flung down his hoe in disgust and straightened his aching
shoulders. The whole sordid transaction put him in mind of the greedy
onslaught of a horde of hungry ants on a beautiful, defenseless
flower, its torn corolla exuding sweetness.... And there must be some
sort of reason behind it. Why had Lydia Orr come to Brookville?</p>

<p>And here, unwittingly, Jim's blind conjectures followed those of
Wesley Elliot. He had told Lydia Orr he meant to call upon her. That
he had not yet accomplished his purpose had been due to the
watchfulness of Mrs. Solomon Black. On the two occasions when he had
rung Mrs. Black's front door-bell, that lady herself had appeared in
response to its summons. On both occasions she had informed Mr. Dodge
tartly that Miss Orr wasn't at home.</p>

<p>On the occasion of his second disappointment he had offered to
await the young lady's home-coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ain't no use of that, Jim,&rdquo; Mrs. Black had
assured him. &ldquo;Miss Orr's gone t' Boston to stay two
days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she had unlatched her close-shut lips to add: &ldquo;She goes
there frequent, on business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes appeared to inform him further that Miss Orr's business,
of whatever nature, was none of <em>his</em> business and never would
be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That old girl is down on me for some reason or
other,&rdquo; he told himself ruefully, as he walked away for the
second time. But he was none the less resolved to pursue his
hopefully nascent friendship with Lydia Orr.</p>

<p>He was thinking of her vaguely as he walked toward the house which
had been his father's, and where he and Fanny had been born. It was
little and low and old, as he viewed it indifferently in the fading
light of the sunset sky. Its walls had needed painting so long, that
for years nobody had even mentioned the subject. Its picturesquely
mossy roof leaked. But a leaky roof was a commonplace in Brookville.
It was customary to set rusty tin pans, their holes stopped with
rags, under such spots as actually let in water; the emptying of the
pans being a regular household &ldquo;chore.&rdquo;  Somehow, he
found himself disliking to enter; his mother and Fanny would still be
talking about the disposition of Lydia Orr's money. To his relief he
found his sister alone in the kitchen, which served as a general
living room. The small square table neatly spread for two stood
against the wall; Fanny was standing by the window, her face close to
the pane, and apparently intent upon the prospect without, which
comprised a grassy stretch of yard flanked by a dull rampart of
over-grown lilac bushes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's mother?&rdquo; inquired Jim, as he hung his hat on
the accustomed nail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She went down to the village,&rdquo; said Fanny, turning
her back on the window with suspicious haste. &ldquo;There was a
meeting of the sewing society at Mrs. Daggett's.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; exclaimed Jim. &ldquo;What an
opportunity!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Opportunity?&rdquo; echoed Fanny vaguely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; for talking it over. Can't you imagine the clack of
tongues; the &lsquo;I says to <em>her</em>,&rsquo; and &lsquo;she
told <em>me</em>,&rsquo; and &lsquo;what <em>do</em> you
think!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't be sarcastic and disagreeable, Jim,&rdquo; advised
Fanny, with some heat. &ldquo;When you think of it, it <em>is</em> a
wonder&mdash;that girl coming here the way she did; buying out the
fair, just as everybody was discouraged over it. And
now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you explain it, Fan?&rdquo; asked her brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Explain it? I can't explain it. Nobody seems to know
anything about her, except that she's from Boston and seems to have
heaps of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim was wiping his hands on the roller-towel behind the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a chance to annex a little more of Miss Orr's money
today,&rdquo; he observed grimly. &ldquo;But I haven't made up my
mind yet whether to do it, or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny laughed and shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don't, somebody else will,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;It was Deacon Whittle, wasn't it? He stopped at the house this
afternoon and wanted to know where to find you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They're going right to work on the old place, and there's
plenty to do for everybody, including yours truly, at four dollars a
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of work?&rdquo; inquired Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All sorts: pulling down and building up; clearing away and
replanting. The place is a jungle, you know. But four dollars a day!
It's like taking candy from a baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a great deal,&rdquo; said the girl.
&ldquo;But why shouldn't you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, indeed? I might earn enough to put a shingle or two on
our own roof. It looks like honest money; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny was busy putting the finishing touches to the supper
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother's going to stop for tea at Mrs. Daggett's, and go to
prayer meeting afterward,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We may as well
eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two sat down, facing each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you mean, Jim?&rdquo; asked Fanny, as she passed
the bread plate to her brother. &ldquo;You said, &lsquo;It looks like
honest money; but&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I'm a fool,&rdquo; he grumbled; &ldquo;but there's
something about the whole business I don't like.... Have some of this
apple sauce, Fan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl passed her plate for a spoonful of the thick compound,
and in return shoved the home-dried beef toward her brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see anything queer about it,&rdquo; she replied
dully. &ldquo;I suppose a person with money might come to Brookville
and want to buy a house. The old Bolton place used to be beautiful,
mother says. I suppose it can be again. And if she chooses to spend
her money that way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's just the point I can't see: why on earth should she
want to saddle herself with a proposition like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny's mute lips trembled. She was thinking she knew very well
why Lydia Orr had chosen to come to Brookville: in some way unknown
to Fanny, Miss Orr had chanced to meet the incomparable Wesley
Elliot, and had straightway set her affections upon him. Fanny had
been thinking it over, ever since the night of the social at Mrs.
Solomon Black's. Up to the moment when Wesley&mdash;she couldn't help
calling him Wesley still&mdash;had left her, on pretense of fetching
a chair, she had instantly divined that it was a pretense, and of
course he had not returned. Her cheeks tingled hotly as she recalled
the way in which Joyce Fulsom had remarked the plate of melting ice
cream on the top shelf of Mrs. Black's what-not:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess Mr. Elliot forgot his cream,&rdquo; the girl had
said, with a spark of malice. &ldquo;I saw him out in the yard awhile
ago talking to that Miss Orr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny had humiliated herself still further by pretending she
didn't know it was the minister who had left his ice cream to
dissolve in a pink and brown puddle of sweetness. Whereat Joyce
Fulsom had giggled disagreeably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better keep your eye on him, Fan,&rdquo; she had
advised.</p>

<p>Of course she couldn't speak of this to Jim; but it was all plain
enough to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm going down to the village for awhile, Fan,&rdquo; her
brother said, as he arose from the table. But he did not, as was his
custom, invite her to accompany him.</p>

<p>After Jim had gone, Fanny washed the dishes with mechanical
swiftness. Her mother had asked her if she would come to prayer
meeting, and walk home with her afterwards. Not that Mrs. Dodge was
timid; the neighborhood of Brookville had never been haunted after
nightfall by anything more dangerous than whippoorwills and frogs. A
plaintive chorus of night sounds greeted the girl, as she stepped out
into the darkness. How sweet the honeysuckle and late roses smelled
under the dew! Fanny walked slowly across the yard to the old
summer-house, where the minister had asked her to call him Wesley,
and sat down. It was very dark under the thick-growing vines, and
after awhile tranquillity of a sort stole over the girl's spirit. She
gazed out into the dim spaces beyond the summer-house and thought,
with a curious detachment, of all that had happened. It was as if she
had grown old and was looking back calmly to a girlhood long since
past. She could almost smile at the recollection of herself stifling
her sobs in her pillow, lest Jim should hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I care for him?&rdquo; she asked herself
wonderingly; and could not tell.</p>

<p>Then all at once she found herself weeping softly, her head on the
rickety table.</p>

<p>Jim Dodge, too intently absorbed in his own confused thoughts to
pay much attention to Fanny, had walked resolutely in the direction
of Mrs. Solomon Black's house; from which, he reflected, the minister
would be obliged to absent himself for at least an hour. He hoped
Mrs. Black had not induced Lydia to go to the prayer meeting with
her. Why any one should voluntarily go to a prayer meeting passed his
comprehension. Jim had once attended what was known as a
&ldquo;protracted meeting,&rdquo; for the sole purpose of pleasing
his mother, who all at once had appeared tearfully anxious about his
&ldquo;soul.&rdquo;  He had not enjoyed the experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you saved, my dear young brother?&rdquo; Deacon Whittle
had inquired of him, in his snuffling, whining, peculiarly
objectionable tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From what, Deacon?&rdquo; Jim had blandly inquired.
&ldquo;You in for it, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereat the Deacon had piously shaken his head and referred him to
the &ldquo;mourner's pew,&rdquo; with the hope that he might even yet
be plucked as a brand from the burning.</p>

<p>Lydia had not gone to the prayer meeting. She was sitting on the
piazza, quite alone. She arose when her determined visitor boldly
walked up the steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is you!&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>An unreasonable feeling of elation arose in the young man's
breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you think I wasn't coming?&rdquo; he inquired, with all
the egotism of which he had been justly accused.</p>

<p>He did not wait for her reply; but proceeded with considerable
humor to describe his previous unsuccessful attempts to see her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;Mrs. Solomon Black has
kindly warned you against me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She could not deny it; so smiled instead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;I give you my word
I'm not a villain: I neither drink, steal, nor gamble. But I'm not a
saint, after the prescribed Brookville pattern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He appeared rather proud of the fact, she thought. Aloud she said,
with pardonable curiosity:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the Brookville pattern? I ought to know, since I am
to live here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this he dropped his bantering tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to talk to you about that,&rdquo; he said
gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About your buying the old Bolton place and paying such a
preposterous price for it, and all the rest, including the minister's
back-pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She remained silent, playing with the ribbon of her sash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a sort of inward conviction that you're not doing it
because you think Brookville is such a pleasant place to live
in,&rdquo; he went on, keenly observant of the sudden color
fluttering in her cheeks, revealed by the light of Mrs. Solomon
Black's parlor lamp which stood on a stand just inside the carefully
screened window. &ldquo;It looks,&rdquo; he finished, &ldquo;as if
you&mdash;well; it may be a queer thing for me to say; but I'll tell
you frankly that when mother showed me the check she got today I felt
that it was&mdash;charity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;You are quite,
quite in the wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you can't make me believe that with all your
money&mdash;pardon me for mentioning what everybody in the village is
talking about&mdash; You'll have to convince me that the old Bolton
place has oil under it, or coal or diamonds, before
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should you need to be convinced of anything so
unlikely?&rdquo; she asked, with gentle coldness.</p>

<p>He reddened angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it's none of my business,&rdquo; he conceded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't mean that. But, naturally, I could have no idea of
coal or oil&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; I won't work for you at any four dollars a
day,&rdquo; he said loudly. &ldquo;I thought I'd like to tell
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want you to,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Didn't Deacon
Whittle give you my message?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got hurriedly to his feet with a muttered exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please sit down, Mr. Dodge,&rdquo; she bade him tranquilly.
&ldquo;I've been wanting to see you all day. But there are so few
telephones in Brookville it is difficult to get word to
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He eyed her with stubborn resentment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I meant to say was that four dollars a day is too
much! Don't you know anything about the value of money, Miss Orr?
Somebody ought to have common honesty enough to inform you that there
are plenty of men in Brookville who would be thankful to work for two
dollars a day. I would, for one; and I won't take a cent
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was frowning a little over these statements. The stalwart
young man in shabby clothes who sat facing her under the light of
Mrs. Solomon Black's well-trimmed lamp appeared to puzzle her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why shouldn't you want to earn all you can?&rdquo; she
propounded at last. &ldquo;Isn't there anything you need to use money
for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just a few things,&rdquo; he admitted grudgingly.
&ldquo;I suppose you've noticed that I'm not exactly the glass of
fashion and the mold of form.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was instantly ashamed of himself for the crude personality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must think I'm a fool!&rdquo; burst from him, under the
sting of his self-inflicted lash.</p>

<p>She smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm not at all the sort of person you appear to think
me,&rdquo; she said. Her grave blue eyes looked straight into his.
&ldquo;But don't let's waste time trying to be clever: I want to ask
you if you are willing, for a fair salary, to take charge of the
outdoor improvements at Bolton House.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She colored swiftly at sight of the quizzical lift of his
brows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've decided to call my place &lsquo;Bolton House&rsquo;
for several reasons,&rdquo; she went on rapidly: &ldquo;for one
thing, everybody has always called it the Bolton place, so it will be
easier for the workmen and everybody to know what place is meant.
Besides, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but the name of Bolton has an ill-omened sound in
Brookville ears,&rdquo; he objected. &ldquo;You've no idea how people
here hate that man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It all happened so long ago, I should think they might
forgive him by now,&rdquo; she offered, after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't call my house after a thief,&rdquo; he said
strongly. &ldquo;There are hundreds of prettier names. Why
not&mdash;Pine Court, for example?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven't told me yet if you will accept the position I
spoke of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He passed his hand over his clean-shaven chin, a trick he had
inherited from his father, and surveyed her steadily from under
meditative brows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place, I'm not a landscape gardener, Miss
Orr,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;That's the sort of man you want. You
can get one in Boston, who'll group your evergreens, open vistas,
build pergolas and all that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You appear to know exactly what I want,&rdquo; she
laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I do,&rdquo; he defied her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, seriously, I don't want and won't have a
landscape-gardener from Boston&mdash;with due deference to your
well-formed opinions, Mr. Dodge. I intend to mess around myself, and
change my mind every other day about all sorts of things. I want to
work things out, not on paper in cold black and white; but in terms
of growing things&mdash;wild things out of the woods. You understand,
I'm sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dawning light in his eyes told her that he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I've had no experience,&rdquo; he hesitated.
&ldquo;Besides, I've considerable farm-work of my own to do. I've
been hoeing potatoes all day. Tomorrow I shall have to go into the
cornfield, or lose my crop. Time, tide and weeds wait for no
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I supposed you were a hunter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed unpleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; he interrupted rudely: &ldquo;you
supposed, in other words, that I was an idle chap, addicted to
wandering about the woods, a gun on my shoulder, a cur&mdash;quite as
much of a ne'er-do-well as myself&mdash;at my heels. Of course Deacon
Whittle and Mrs. Solomon Black have told you all about it. And since
you've set about reforming Brookville, you thought you'd begin with
me. Well, I'm obliged to you; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl arose trembling to her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not kind!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You are not
kind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stood for an instant, gazing into each other's eyes during
one of those flashes of time which sometimes count for years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he muttered huskily. &ldquo;I'm a brute
at best; but I had no business to speak to you as I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did you say&mdash;what made you ever think I'd set
about reforming&mdash;that is what you
said&mdash;<em>reforming</em>&mdash;Brookville? I never thought of
such a thing! How could I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hung his head, abashed by the lightning in her mild eyes.</p>

<p>She clasped her small, fair hands and bent toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you said you wanted to be&mdash;friends. I
hoped&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he said gruffly. &ldquo;I've told you I'm
ashamed of myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew back, sighing deeply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want you to feel&mdash;ashamed,&rdquo; she said, in
a sweet, tired voice. &ldquo;But I wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo; he urged, when she did not finish her
sentence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think everybody is going to misunderstand me, as you
have?&rdquo; she asked, somewhat piteously. &ldquo;Is it so strange
and unheard of a thing for a woman to want a home and&mdash;and
friends? Isn't it allowable for a person who has money to want to pay
fair wages? Why should I scrimp and haggle and screw, when I want
most of all to be generous?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he told her seriously, &ldquo;scrimping,
haggling and screwing have been the fashion for so long, the other
thing rouses mean suspicions by its very novelty. It's too good to be
true; that's all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean people will suspect&mdash;they'll think there's
something&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood before him, her hands fallen at her sides, her eyes
downcast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I confess I couldn't believe that there wasn't an ulterior
motive,&rdquo; he said honestly. &ldquo;That's where I was less noble
than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flashed a sudden strange look at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;I'm going to be
honest&mdash;with you. I have&mdash;an ulterior motive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me what it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her lips formed the single word of denial.</p>

<p>He gazed at her in silence for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm going to accept the post you just offered me, Miss Orr;
at any salary you think I'm worth,&rdquo; he said gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

<p>Steps and the sound of voices floated across the picket fence. The
gate rasped on its rusted hinges; then slammed shut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I was you, Mr. Elliot,&rdquo; came the penetrating
accents of Mrs. Solomon Black's voice, &ldquo;I should hire a reg'lar
reviv'list along in th' fall, after preservin' an' house-cleanin'
time. We need an outpourin' of grace, right here in Brookville; and
we can't get it no other way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the minister's cultured voice in reply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall give your suggestion the most careful
consideration, Mrs. Black, between now and the autumn
season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; exclaimed Jim Dodge; &ldquo;this is no
place for me! Good night, Miss Orr!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laid her hand in his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can trust me,&rdquo; he said briefly, and became on the
instant a flitting shadow among the lilac bushes, lightly vaulting
over the fence and mingling with the darker shadows beyond.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter IX</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Henry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Daggett, as she smilingly set
a plate of perfectly browned pancakes before her husband, which he
proceeded to deluge with butter and maple syrup, &ldquo;are you sure
that's <em>so</em>, about the furniture? 'Cause if it is, we've got
two or three o' them things right in this house: that chair you're
settin' in, for one, an' upstairs there's that ol' fashioned brown
bureau, where I keep the sheets 'n' pillow slips. You don't s'pose
she'd want that, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett sank down in a chair opposite her husband, her large
pink and white face damp with moisture. Above her forehead a mist of
airy curls fluttered in the warm breeze from the open window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, ain't it hot!&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I got all het
up a-bakin' them cakes. Shall I fry you another griddleful,
papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They cer'nly do taste kind o' moreish, Abby,&rdquo;
conceded Mr. Daggett thickly. &ldquo;You do beat the Dutch, Abby,
when it comes t' pancakes. Mebbe I could manage a few more of
'em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett beamed sincerest satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; she deprecated happily. &ldquo;Ann
Whittle says I don't mix batter the way she does. But if <em>you</em>
like 'em, Henry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn't be beat, Abby,&rdquo; affirmed Mr. Daggett
sturdily, as he reached for his third cup of coffee.</p>

<p>The cook stove was only a few steps away, so the sizzle of the
batter as it expanded into generous disks on the smoking griddle did
not interrupt the conversation. Mrs. Daggett, in her blue and white
striped gingham, a pancake turner in one plump hand, smiled through
the odorous blue haze like a tutelary goddess. Mr. Daggett, in his
shirt-sleeves, his scant locks brushed carefully over his bald spot,
gazed at her with placid satisfaction. He was thoroughly accustomed
to having Abby wait upon his appetite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got to get down to the store kind of early this morning,
Abby,&rdquo; he observed, frowning slightly at his empty plate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll have 'em for you in two shakes of a lamb's tail,
papa,&rdquo; soothed Mrs. Daggett, to whom the above remark had come
to signify not merely a statement of fact, but a gentle reprimand.
&ldquo;I know you like 'em good and hot; and cold buckwheat cakes
certainly is about th' meanest vict'als.... There!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she transferred a neat pile of the delicate, crisp rounds from
the griddle to her husband's plate with a skill born of long
practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About that furnitur',&rdquo; remarked Mr. Daggett, gazing
thoughtfully at the golden stream of sweetness, stolen from leaf and
branch of the big sugar maples behind the house to supply the pewter
syrup-jug he suspended above his cakes, &ldquo;I guess it's a fact
she wants it, all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think she'd rather have new furniture; Henry, they
do say the house is going to be handsome. But you say she wants the
old stuff? Ain't that queer, for anybody with means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that Orr girl beats me,&rdquo; Mr. Daggett
acknowledged handsomely. &ldquo;She seems kind of soft an' easy, when
you talk to her; but she's got ideas of her own; an' you can't no
more talk 'em out of her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should you try to talk 'em out of her, papa?&rdquo;
inquired Mrs. Daggett mildly. &ldquo;Mebbe her ideas is all right;
and anyhow, s'long as she's paying out good money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she'll pay! she'll pay!&rdquo; said Mr. Daggett, with a
large gesture. &ldquo;Ain't no doubt about her paying for what she
wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shoved his plate aside, and tipped back in his chair with a
heavy yawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's asked me to see about the wall paper, Abby,&rdquo; he
continued, bringing down his chair with a resounding thump of its
sturdy legs. &ldquo;And she's got the most outlandish notions about
it; asked me could I match up what was on the walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Match it up? Why, ain't th' paper all moldered away, Henry,
with the damp an' all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Course it is, Abby; but she says she wants to restore the
house&mdash;fix it up just as 'twas. She says that's th' correct
thing to do. &lsquo;Why, shucks!&rsquo; I sez, &lsquo;the wall papers
they're gettin' out now is a lot handsomer than them old style
papers. You don't want no old stuff like that,&rsquo; I sez. But, I
swan! you can't tell that girl nothing, for all she seems so mild and
meachin'. I was wonderin' if you couldn't shove some sense into her,
Abby. Now, I'd like th' job of furnishin' up that house with new
stuff. &lsquo;I don't carry a very big stock of furniture,&rsquo; I
sez to her; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Hen-ery Daggett!&rdquo; reproved his wife, &ldquo;an'
you a reg'lar professing member of the church! You ain't never
carried no stock of furniture in the store, and you know
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That ain't no sign I ain't never goin' to, Abby,&rdquo;
retorted Mr. Daggett with spirit. &ldquo;We been stuck right down in
the mud here in Brookville since that dratted bank failed. Nobody's
moved, except to the graveyard. And here comes along a young woman
with money ... I'd like mighty well to know just how much she's got
an' where it come from. I asked the Judge, and he says, blamed if he
knows.... But this 'ere young female spells op-per-tunity, Abby. We
got to take advantage of the situation, Abby, same as you do in
blackberrying season: pick 'em when they're ripe; if you don't, the
birds and the bugs'll get 'em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It don't sound right to me, papa,&rdquo; murmured his wife,
her kind face full of soft distress: &ldquo;Taking advantage of a
poor young thing, like her, an' all in mourning, too, fer a near
friend. She told Lois so ... Dear, dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Daggett had filled his morning pipe and was puffing
energetically in his efforts to make it draw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't <em>say</em> take advantage of
<em>her</em>,&rdquo; he objected. &ldquo;That's somethin' I never
done yet in my business, Abby. Th' Lord knows I don't sand my sugar
nor water my vinegar, the way some storekeepers do. I'm all for
&lsquo;live an' let live.&rsquo;  What I says was&mdash;... Now, you
pay attention to me, Abby, and quit sniffling. You're a good woman;
but you're about as soft as that there butter! ...&rdquo;</p>

<p>The article in question had melted to a yellow pool under the
heat. Mrs. Daggett gazed at it with wide blue eyes, like those of a
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Henry,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;I never heerd you
talk so before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And likely you won't again. Now you listen, Abby; all I
want, is to do what honest business I can with this young woman.
She's bound to spend her money, and she's kind of took to me; comes
into th' store after her mail, and hangs around and buys the greatest
lot o' stuff&mdash; &lsquo;Land!&rsquo; I says to her: &lsquo;a
body'd think you was getting ready to get married.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now I shouldn't wonder&mdash;&rdquo; began Mrs.
Daggett eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you get excited, Abby. She says she ain't; real
pointed, too. But about this wall paper; I don't know as I can match
up them stripes and figures. I wisht you'd go an' see her, Abby.
She'll tell you all about it. An' her scheme about collecting all the
old Bolton furniture is perfectly ridiculous. 'Twouldn't be worth
shucks after kickin' 'round folk's houses here in Brookville for the
last fifteen years or so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you can't never find her at home, Henry,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Daggett. &ldquo;I been to see her lots of times; but Mis'
Solomon Black says she don't stay in the house hardly long enough to
eat her victuals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you take the buggy, Abby, and drive out to the
old place?&rdquo; suggested Mr. Daggett. &ldquo;Likely you'll find
her there. She appears to take an interest in every nail that's
drove. I can spare the horse this afternoon just as well as
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Twould be pleasant,&rdquo; purred Mrs. Daggett.
&ldquo;But, I suppose, by rights, I ought to take Lois
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; disagreed her husband, shaking his head.
&ldquo;Don't you take Lois; she wouldn't talk confiding to Lois, the
way she would to you. You've got a way with you, Abby. I'll bet you
could coax a bird off a bush as easy as pie, if you was a mind
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett's big body shook with soft laughter. She beamed
rosily on her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How you do go on, Henry!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;But I
ain't going to coax Lydia Orr off no bush she's set her heart on.
She's got the sweetest face, papa; an' I know, without anybody
telling me, whatever she does or wants to do is <em>all</em>
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Daggett had by now invested his portly person in a clean linen
coat, bearing on its front the shining mark of Mrs. Daggett's careful
iron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here, Abby,&rdquo; he said kindly: &ldquo;whatever you
do, Abby, suits <em>me</em> all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The worthy couple parted for the morning: Mr. Daggett for the
scene of his activities in the post office and store; Mrs. Daggett to
set her house to rights and prepare for the noon meal, when her Henry
liked to &ldquo;eat hearty of good, nourishing victuals,&rdquo; after
his light repast of the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess I'll wear my striped muslin,&rdquo; said Mrs. Daggett
to herself happily. &ldquo;Ain't it lucky it's all clean an' fresh?
'Twill be so cool to wear out buggy-ridin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett was always finding occasion for thus reminding
herself of her astonishing good fortune. She had formed the habit of
talking aloud to herself as she worked about the house and
garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Tain't near as lonesome, when you can hear the sound of a
voice&mdash;if it is only your own,&rdquo; she apologized, when
rebuked for the practice by her friend Mrs. Maria Dodge. &ldquo;Mebbe
it does sound kind of crazy&mdash; You say lunatics does it
constant&mdash;but, I don't know, Maria, I've a kind of a notion
there's them that hears, even if you can't see 'em. And mebbe they
answer, too&mdash;in your thought-ear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to be careful, Abby,&rdquo; warned Mrs. Dodge,
shaking her head. &ldquo;It makes the chills go up and down my back
to hear you talk like that; and they don't allow no such doctrines in
the church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Apostle Paul allowed 'em,&rdquo; Mrs. Daggett pointed
out, &ldquo;so did the Psalmist. You read your Bible, Maria, with
that in mind, and you'll see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the spacious, sunlighted chamber of her soul, devoted to the
memory of her two daughters who had died in early childhood, Mrs.
Daggett sometimes permitted herself to picture Nellie and Minnie,
grown to angelic girlhood, and keeping her company about her lonely
household tasks in the intervals not necessarily devoted to harp
playing in the Celestial City. She laughed softly to herself as she
filled two pies with sliced sour apples and dusted them plentifully
with spice and sugar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd admire to see papa argufying with that sweet
girl,&rdquo; she observed to the surrounding silence. &ldquo;Papa
certainly is set on having his own way. Guess bin' alone here with me
so constant, he's got kind of willful. But it don't bother me any;
ain't that lucky?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hurried her completed pies into the oven with a swiftness of
movement she had never lost, her sweet, thin soprano soaring high in
the words of a winding old hymn tune: <blockquote>Lord, how we grovel
here below,<br> Fond of these trifling toys;<br> Our souls can
neither rise nor go<br> To taste supernal joys! ...</blockquote>

<p>It was nearly two o'clock before the big brown horse, indignant at
the unwonted invasion of his afternoon leisure, stepped slowly out
from the Daggett barn. On the seat of the old-fashioned vehicle, to
which he had been attached by Mrs. Daggett's skillful hands, that
lady herself sat placidly erect, arrayed in her blue and white
striped muslin. Mrs. Daggett conscientiously wore stripes at all
seasons of the year: she had read somewhere that stripes impart to
the most rotund of figures an appearance of slimness totally at
variance with the facts. As for blue and white, her favorite
combination of stripes, any fabric in those colors looked cool and
clean; and there was a vague strain of poetry in Mrs. Daggett's
nature which made her lift her eyes to a blue sky filled with
floating white clouds with a sense of rapturous satisfaction wholly
unrelated to the state of the weather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;G'long, Dolly!&rdquo; she bade the reluctant animal, with a
gentle slap of leathern reins over a rotund back.
&ldquo;Git-ap!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dolly,&rdquo; who might have been called C&aelig;sar, both
by reason of his sex and a stubbornly dominant nature, now
fortunately subdued by years of chastening experience, strode slowly
forward, his eyes rolling, his large hoofs stirring up heavy clouds
of dust. There were sweet-smelling meadows stacked with newly-cured
hay on either side of the road, and tufts of red clover blossoms
exhaling delicious odors of honey almost under his saturnine nose;
but he trotted ponderously on, sullenly aware of the gentle hand on
the reins and the mild, persistent voice which bade him
&ldquo;Git-ap, Dolly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Lois Daggett, carrying a black silk bag, which contained a
prospectus of the invaluable work which she was striving to introduce
to an unappreciative public, halted the vehicle before it had reached
the outskirts of the village.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you going, Abby?&rdquo; she demanded, in the
privileged tone of authority a wife should expect from her husband's
female relatives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just out in the country a piece, Lois,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Daggett evasively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I'll git in and ride a ways with you,&rdquo;
said Lois Daggett. &ldquo;Cramp your wheel, Abby,&rdquo; she added
sharply. &ldquo;I don't want to git my skirt all dust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Daggett was wearing a black alpaca skirt and a white
shirtwaist, profusely ornamented with what is known as coronation
braid. Her hair, very tightly frizzed, projected from beneath the
brim of her straw hat on both sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm going out to see if I can catch that Orr girl this
afternoon,&rdquo; she explained, as she took a seat beside her
sister-in-law. &ldquo;She ought to want a copy of Famous
People&mdash;in the best binding, too. I ain't sold a leather-bound
yit, not even in Grenoble. They come in red with gold lettering.
You'd ought to have one, Abby, now that Henry's gitting more business
by the minute. I should think you might afford one, if you ain't too
stingy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe we could, Lois,&rdquo; said Mrs. Daggett amiably.
&ldquo;I've always thought I'd like to know more about famous people:
what they eat for breakfast, and how they do their back hair
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't be silly, Abby,&rdquo; Miss Daggett bade her sharply.
&ldquo;There ain't any such nonsense in Famous People! <em>I</em>
wouldn't be canvassing for it, if there was.&rdquo;  And she shifted
her pointed nose to one side with a slight, genteel sniff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Git-ap, Dolly!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Daggett, gently
slapping the reins.</p>

<p>Dolly responded by a single swift gesture of his tail which firmly
lashed the hated reminder of bondage to his hind quarters. Then
wickedly pretending that he was not aware of what had happened he
strolled to the side of the road nearest the hay field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, if he ain't gone and got his tail over the
lines!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Daggett indignantly. &ldquo;He's got more
resistin' strength in that tail of his'n&mdash;wonder if I
can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She leaned over the dashboard and grasped the offending member
with both hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hang onto the lines, Lois, and give 'em a good jerk the
minute I loosen up his tail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The subsequent failure of this attempt deflected the malicious
Dolly still further from the path of duty. A wheel cramped and lifted
perilously.</p>

<p>Miss Daggett squealed shrilly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He'll tip the buggy over&mdash;he'll tip the buggy over!
For pity's sake, Abby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett stepped briskly out of the vehicle and seized the
bridle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain't you ashamed?&rdquo; she demanded sternly. &ldquo;You
loosen up that there tail o' yourn this minute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got 'em!&rdquo; announced Miss Daggett, triumphantly.
&ldquo;He loosened right up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She handed the recovered reins to her sister-in-law, and the two
ladies resumed their journey and their conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never was so scared in all my life,&rdquo; stated Lois
Daggett, straightening her hat which had assumed a rakish angle over
one ear. &ldquo;I should think you'd be afraid to drive such a horse,
Abby. What in creation would have happened to you if I hadn't been in
the buggy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As like as not he wouldn't have took a notion with his
tail, Lois, if I'd been driving him alone,&rdquo; hazarded Mrs.
Daggett mildly. &ldquo;Dolly's an awful knowing horse.... Git-ap,
Dolly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me, Abby Daggett, that there horse of
Henry's has took a spite against <em>me?</em>&rdquo; demanded the
spinster.... &ldquo;Mebbe he's a mind-reader,&rdquo; she added
darkly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I didn't mean nothin' like that, Lois,&rdquo; her
sister-in-law assured her pacifically. &ldquo;What I meant to say
was: I got so interested in what you were saying, Lois, that I
handled the reins careless, and he took advantage.... Git-ap, Dolly!
Don't you see, Lois, even a horse knows the difference when two
ladies is talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd ought to learn to say exactly what you mean,
Abby,&rdquo; commented Miss Daggett.</p>

<p>She glanced suspiciously at the fresh striped muslin, which was
further enhanced by a wide crocheted collar and a light blue satin
bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where'd you say you were goin' this afternoon,
Abby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said out in the country a piece, Lois; it's such a nice
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, <em>I</em> should think Henry'd be needing the horse
for his business. I know <em>I'd</em> never think of asking him for
it&mdash;and me a blood relation, too, trying to earn my bread and
butter tramping around the country with Famous People.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett, thus convicted of heartless selfishness, sighed
vaguely. Henry's sister always made her feel vastly uncomfortable,
even sinful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, Lois, we'd be real glad to have you come and live
with us constant,&rdquo; she said heroically.... &ldquo;Git-ap,
Dolly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Daggett compressed her thin lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I'm too independent for that, Abby, an' you know it. If
poor Henry was to be left a widower, I might consider living in his
house and doing for him; but you know, Abby, there's very few houses
big enough for two women.... And that r'minds me; did you know Miss
Orr has got a hired girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Daggett, welcoming the change
of subject with cordial interest. &ldquo;A hired girl! ...Git-ap,
Dolly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; confirmed Miss Daggett. &ldquo;Lute Parsons was
telling me she came in on th' noon train yesterday. She brought a
trunk with her, and her check was from Boston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I want to know!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Daggett.
&ldquo;Boston's where <em>she</em> came from, ain't it? It'll be real
pleasant for her to have somebody from Boston right in the house....
G'long, Dolly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know why you should be so sure of that,
Abby,&rdquo; sniffed Miss Daggett. &ldquo;I should think a person
from right here in Brookville would be more company. How can a hired
girl from Boston view the passin' and tell her who's goin' by? I
think it's a ridiculous idea, myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn't wonder if it's somebody she knows,&rdquo;
surmised Mrs. Daggett. &ldquo;'Twould be real pleasant for her to
have a hired girl that's mebbe worked for her folks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend to ask her, if she comes to the door,&rdquo;
stated Lois Daggett. &ldquo;You can drop me right at the gate; and if
you ain't going too far with your buggy-riding, Abby, you might stop
and take me up a spell later. It's pretty warm to walk far
today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I was thinkin' mebbe I'd stop in there, too,
Lois,&rdquo; said Mrs. Daggett apologetically. &ldquo;I ain't been to
see Miss Orr for quite a spell, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spinster turned and fixed a scornfully, intelligent gaze upon
the mild, rosy countenance of her sister-in-law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>I see!</em>&rdquo; she sniffed. &ldquo;That was
where you was pointing for, all the while! And you didn't let on to
me, oh, no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Lois, don't you get excited,&rdquo; exhorted Mrs.
Daggett. &ldquo;It was just about the wall papers. Henry, he says to
me this mornin'&mdash;... Git-ap, Dolly!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;&lsquo;Henry says&mdash;Henry says&rsquo;!</em>  Yes; I
guess so! What do you know about wall papers, Abby? ...Well, all I
got to say is: I don't want nobody looking on an' interfering when
I'm trying to sell &lsquo;Lives of Famous People.&rsquo;  Folks, es a
rule, ain't so interested in anything they got to pay out money fer,
an' I want a clear field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won't say a word till you're all through talkin',
Lois,&rdquo; promised Mrs. Daggett meekly. &ldquo;Mebbe she'd kind of
hate to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; before me. She's took a real liking to
Henry.... Git-ap, Dolly.... And anyway, she's awful generous. I could
say, kind of careless; &lsquo;If I was you, I'd take a
leather-bound.&rsquo;  Couldn't I, Lois?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you can come in, Abby, if you're so terrible
anxious,&rdquo; relented Miss Daggett. &ldquo;You might tell her, you
and Henry was going to take a leather-bound; that might have some
effect. I remember once I sold three Famous People in a row in one
street. There couldn't one o' them women endure to think of her next
door neighbor having something she didn't have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so, Lois,&rdquo; beamed Mrs. Daggett. &ldquo;The
most of folks is about like that. Why, I rec'lect once, Henry brought
me up a red-handled broom from th' store. My! it wa'n't no time
b'fore he was cleaned right out of red-handled brooms. Nobody wanted
'em natural color, striped, or blue. Henry, he says to me,
&lsquo;What did you do to advertise them red-handled brooms,
Abby?&rsquo;  &lsquo;Why, papa,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I swept off my
stoop and the front walk a couple of times, that's all.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;broom-handles is as catching as
measles, if you only get 'em th' right color!&rsquo; ... Git-ap,
Dolly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, did you <em>ever!</em>&rdquo; breathed Miss Daggett
excitedly, leaning out of the buggy to gaze upon the scene of
activity displayed on the further side of the freshly-pruned hedge
which divided Miss Lydia Orr's property from the road:
&ldquo;Painters and carpenters and masons, all going at once! And
ain't that Jim Dodge out there in the side yard talking to her? 'Tis,
as sure as I'm alive! I wonder what <em>he's</em> doing? Go right in,
Abby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I kind of hate to drive Dolly in on that fresh
gravel,&rdquo; hesitated Mrs. Daggett. &ldquo;He's so heavy on his
feet he'll muss it all up. Mebbe I'd better hitch out in
front.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She sees us, Abby; go on in!&rdquo; commanded Miss Daggett
masterfully. &ldquo;I guess when it comes to that, her gravel ain't
any better than other folks' gravel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus urged, Mrs. Daggett guided the sulky brown horse between the
big stone gateposts and brought him to a standstill under the
somewhat pretentious <i>porte-coch&egrave;re</i> of the Bolton
house.</p>

<p>Lydia Orr was beside the vehicle in a moment, her face bright with
welcoming smiles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Mrs. Daggett,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I'm so glad
you've come. I've been wanting to see you all day. I'm sure you can
tell me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You've met my husband's sister, Miss Lois Daggett, haven't
you, Miss Orr? She's the lady that made that beautiful drawn-in mat
you bought at the fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Orr shook hands cordially with the author of the drawn-in
mat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come right in,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You'll want to see
what we're doing inside, though nothing is finished yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She led the way to a small room off the library, its long French
windows opening on a balcony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This room used to be a kind of a den, they tell me; so I've
made it into one, the first thing, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a rug on the floor, a chair or two and a high mahogany
desk which gave the place a semblance of comfort amid the general
confusion. Miss Lois Daggett gazed about with argus-eyed
curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know as I was ever in this room, when Andrew Bolton
lived here,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;but it looks real homelike
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor man! I often think of him,&rdquo; said kindly Mrs.
Daggett. &ldquo;'Twould be turrible to be shut away from the sunshine
f'r even one year; but poor Andrew Bolton's been closed up in State's
prison fer&mdash;l' me see, it mus' be goin' on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's fifteen years, come fall, since he got his
sentence,&rdquo; stated the spinster. &ldquo;His time must be 'most
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia Orr had seated herself in an old-fashioned chair, its tall
carved back turned to the open windows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you&mdash;lose much in the bank failure, Miss
Daggett?&rdquo; she inquired, after a slight pause, during which the
promoter of Famous People was loosening the strings of her black silk
bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About two hundred dollars I'd saved up,&rdquo; replied Miss
Daggett. &ldquo;By now it would be a lot more&mdash;with the
interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; assented their hostess; &ldquo;one
should always think of interest in connection with
savings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She appeared to be gazing rather attentively at the leather-bound
prospectus Miss Daggett had withdrawn from her bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That looks like something interesting, Miss Daggett,&rdquo;
she volunteered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This volume I'm holdin' in my hand,&rdquo; began that lady,
professionally, &ldquo;is one of the most remarkable works ever
issued by the press of any country. It is the life history of one
thousand men and women of world-wide fame and reputation, in letters,
art, science <em>an'</em> public life. No library nor parlor table is
complete without this authoritative work of general information
<em>an'</em> reference. It is a com-plete library in itself,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the price of the work, Miss Daggett?&rdquo;
inquired Lydia Orr.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just hold on a minute; I'm coming to that,&rdquo; said Miss
Daggett firmly. &ldquo;As I was telling you, this work is a complete
library in itself. A careful perusal of the specimen pages will
convince the most skeptical. Turning to page four hundred and
fifty-six, we read:&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<img src="images/ab3.jpg" width="710" height="1098"
alt="[Illustration: &ldquo;Just hold on a minute; I'm coming to
that,&rdquo; said Miss Daggett firmly.]">

<p>&ldquo;I'm sure I should like to buy the book, Miss
Daggett.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ain't th' only one,&rdquo; said the agent. &ldquo;Any
person of even the most ordinary intelligence ought to own this work.
Turning to page four hundred and fifty-six, we read: &lsquo;Snipeley,
Samuel Bangs: lawyer ligislator <em>an'</em> author; born eighteen
hundred fifty-nine, in the town of&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment the door was pushed noiselessly open, and a tall,
spare woman of middle age stood upon the threshold bearing a tray in
her hands. On the tray were set forth silver tea things, flanked by
thin bread and butter and a generous pile of sponge cake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be tired and thirsty after your drive,&rdquo; said
Lydia Orr hospitably. &ldquo;You may set the tray here,
Martha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maid complied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I must have that book, Miss Daggett,&rdquo; their
hostess went on. &ldquo;You didn't mention the title, nor the price.
Won't you have a cup of tea, Mrs. Daggett?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That cup of tea looks real nice; but I'm afraid you've gone
to a lot of trouble and put yourself out,&rdquo; protested Mrs.
Daggett, who had not ventured to open her lips until then. What
wonderful long words Lois had used; and how convincing had been her
manner. Mrs. Daggett had resolved that &ldquo;Lives of Famous
People,&rdquo; in its best red leather binding, should adorn her own
parlor table in the near future, if she could persuade Henry to
consent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that book Lois is canvassing for is just
lovely,&rdquo; she added artfully, as she helped herself to cake.
&ldquo;I'm awful anxious to own one; just think, I'd never even heard
of Snipeley Samuel Bangs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lois Daggett crowed with laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fer pity sake, Abby! don't you know no better than that?
It's Samuel Bangs Snipeley; he was County Judge, the author of
&lsquo;Platform Pearls,&rsquo; and was returned to legislature four
times by his constituents, besides being&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you spare me five copies of the book, Miss
Daggett?&rdquo; inquired Lydia, handing her the sponge cake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five copies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Daggett swiftly controlled her agitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven't told you the price, yet. You'd want one of them
leather-bound, wouldn't you? They come high, but they wear real well,
and I will say there's nothing handsomer for a parlor
table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want them all leather-bound,&rdquo; said Lydia, smiling.
&ldquo;I want one for myself, one for a library and the other
three&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's nothing neater for a Christmas or birthday
present!&rdquo; shrilled Lois Daggett joyously. &ldquo;And so
informing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She swallowed her tea in short, swift gulps; her faded eyes shone.
Inwardly she was striving to compute the agent's profit on five
leather-bound copies of Famous People. She almost said aloud &ldquo;I
can have a new dress!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We've been thinking,&rdquo; Lydia Orr said composedly,
&ldquo;that it might be pleasant to open a library and reading room
in the village. What do you think of the idea, Miss Daggett? You seem
interested in books, and I thought possibly you might like to take
charge of the work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, me?&mdash; Take charge of a library?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lois Daggett's eyes became on the instant watchful and suspicious.
Lydia Orr had encountered that look before, on the faces of men and
even of boys. Everybody was afraid of being cheated, she thought. Was
this just in Brookville, and because of the misdeeds of one man, so
long ago?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we shall have to talk it over some other day,
when we have more time,&rdquo; she said gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn't that be nice!&rdquo; said Mrs. Daggett. &ldquo;I
was in a library once, over to Grenoble. Even school children were
coming in constant to get books. But I never thought we could have
one in Brookville. Where could we have it, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; that's the trouble,&rdquo; chimed in Lois.
&ldquo;There isn't any place fit for anything like that in our
town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia glanced appealingly from one to the other of the two faces.
One might have thought her irresolute&mdash;or even afraid of their
verdict.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had thought,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;of buying the
old Bolton bank building. It has not been used for anything, Judge
Fulsom says, since&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; it ain't,&rdquo; acquiesced Mrs. Daggett soberly,
&ldquo;not since&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She fell silent, thinking of the dreadful winter after the bank
failure, when scarlet fever raged among the impoverished homes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's been some talk, off and on, of opening a store
there,&rdquo; chimed in Lois Daggett, setting down her cup with a
clash; &ldquo;but I guess nobody'd patronize it. Folks don't forget
so easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it's a good substantial building,&rdquo; Lydia went on,
her eyes resting on Mrs. Daggett's broad, rosy face, which still wore
that unwonted look of pain and sadness. &ldquo;It seems a pity not to
change the&mdash;the associations. The library and reading room could
be on the first floor; and on the second, perhaps, a town hall,
where&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the land sake!&rdquo; ejaculated Lois Daggett;
&ldquo;you cer'nly have got an imagination, Miss Orr. I haven't heard
that town hall idea spoken of since Andrew Bolton's time. He was
always talking about town improvements; wanted a town hall and
courses of lectures, and a fountain playing in a park and a
fire-engine, and the land knows what. He was a great hand to talk,
Andrew Bolton was. And you see how he turned out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And mebbe he'd have done all those nice things for
Brookville, Lois, if his speculations had turned out
different,&rdquo; said Mrs. Daggett, charitably. &ldquo;I always
thought Andrew Bolton <em>meant</em> all right. Of course he had to
invest our savings; banks always do, Henry says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know anything about <em>investing</em>, and don't
want to, either&mdash;not the kind he did, anyhow,&rdquo; retorted
Lois Daggett.</p>

<p>She arose as she spoke, brushing the crumbs of sponge cake from
her skirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got to get that order right in,&rdquo; she said:
&ldquo;five copies&mdash;or was it six, you said?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I could use six,&rdquo; murmured Lydia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And all leather-bound! Well, now, I know you won't ever be
sorry. It's one of those works any intelligent person would be proud
to own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sure it is,&rdquo; said the girl gently.</p>

<p>She turned to Mrs. Daggett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can't you stay awhile longer? I&mdash;I should
like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess Abby'd better come right along with me,&rdquo;
put in Lois briskly ... &ldquo;and that reminds me, do you want to
pay something down on that order? As a general thing, where I take a
big order&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;I'd forgotten; I always prefer to pay in
advance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl opened the tall desk and producing a roll of bills told
off the price of her order into Miss Daggett's hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you'd be almost afraid to keep so much ready
money by you, with all those men workin' outside,&rdquo; she
commented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They're all Brookville men,&rdquo; said Lydia. &ldquo;I
have to have money to pay them with. Besides, I have
Martha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean your hired girl, I suppose,&rdquo; inferred Miss
Daggett, rubbing her nose thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She isn't exactly&mdash;a servant,&rdquo; hesitated Lydia.
&ldquo;We give the men their noon meal,&rdquo; she added.
&ldquo;Martha helps me with that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You give them their dinner! Well, I never! Did you hear
that, Abby? She gives them their dinner. Didn't you know men-folks
generally bring their noonings in a pail? Land! I don't know how you
get hearty victuals enough for all those men. Where do they
eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the new barn,&rdquo; said Lydia, smiling. &ldquo;We have
a cook stove out there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain't that just lovely!&rdquo; beamed Mrs. Daggett,
squeezing the girl's slim hand in both her own. &ldquo;Most folks
wouldn't go to the trouble of doing anything so nice. No wonder
they're hustling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe they won't hustle so fast toward the end of the
job,&rdquo; said Lois Daggett. &ldquo;You'll find men-folks are
always ready to take advantage of any kind of foolishness. Come,
Abby; we must be going. You'll get those books in about two weeks,
Miss Orr. A big order takes more time, I always tell
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Daggett. But wouldn't you&mdash;if you are
in a hurry, you know; Mr. Dodge is going to the village in the
automobile; we're expecting some supplies for the house. He'll be
glad to take you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, Jim Dodge? You don't mean to tell me Jim Dodge can
drive an auto! I never stepped foot inside of one of those
contraptions. But I don't know but I might's well die for a sheep as
a lamb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lois Daggett followed the girl from the room in a flutter of
joyous excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can come home when you get ready, Abby,&rdquo; she said
over her shoulder. &ldquo;But you want to be careful driving that
horse of yours; he might cut up something scandalous if he was to
meet an auto.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter X</h4>

<p>Mrs. Daggett was sitting by the window gazing dreamily out, when
Lydia returned after witnessing the triumphant departure of the
promoter of Famous People.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It kind of brings it all back to me,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Daggett, furtively wiping her eyes. &ldquo;It's going t' look pretty
near's it used to. Only I remember Mis' Bolton used to have a flower
garden all along that stone wall over there; she was awful fond of
flowers. I remember I gave her some roots of pinies and iris out of
our yard, and she gave me a new kind of lilac bush&mdash;pink, it is,
and sweet! My! you can smell it a mile off when it's in
blow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you knew&mdash;the Bolton family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl's blue eyes widened wistfully as she asked the
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, my dear. And I want to tell you&mdash;just
betwixt ourselves&mdash;that Andrew Bolton was a real nice man; and
don't you let folks set you t' thinking he wa'n't. Now that you're
going to live right here in this house, my dear, seems to me it would
be a lot pleasanter to know that those who were here before you were
just good, kind folks that had made a mistake. I was saying to Henry
this morning: &lsquo;I'm going to tell her some of the nice things
folks has seemed to forget about the Boltons. It won't do any
harm,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;And it'll be cheerfuller for her.&rsquo;
Now this room we're sitting in&mdash;I remember lots of pleasant
things about this room. 'Twas here&mdash;right at that desk&mdash;he
gave us a check to fix up the church. He was always doing things like
that. But folks don't seem to remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much, dear Mrs. Daggett, for telling
me,&rdquo; murmured Lydia. &ldquo;Indeed it will be&mdash;cheerfuller
for me to know that Andrew Bolton wasn't always&mdash;a thief. I've
sometimes imagined him walking about these rooms.... One can't help
it, you know, in an old house like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett nodded eagerly. Here was one to whom she might impart
some of the secret thoughts and imaginings which even Maria Dodge
would have called &ldquo;outlandish&rdquo;:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Sometimes I've wondered
if&mdash;if mebbe folks don't leave something or other after
them&mdash;something you can't see nor touch; but you can sense it,
just as plain, in your mind. But land! I don't know as I'd ought to
mention it; of course you know I don't mean ghosts and like
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean their&mdash;their thoughts, perhaps,&rdquo;
hesitated Lydia. &ldquo;I can't put it into words; but I know what
you mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett patted the girl's hand kindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've come to talk to you about the wall papers, dearie;
Henry thought mebbe you'd like to see me, seeing I don't forget so
easy's some. This room was done in a real pretty striped paper in two
shades of buff. There's a little of it left behind that door. Mrs.
Bolton was a great hand to want things cheerful. She said it looked
kind of sunshiny, even on a dark day. Poor dear, it fell harder on
her than on anybody else when the crash came. She died the same week
they took him to prison; and fer one, I was glad of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett wiped her kind eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe you'll think it's a terrible thing for me to
say,&rdquo; she added hastily. &ldquo;But she was such a delicate,
soft-hearted sort of a woman: I couldn't help feelin' th' Lord spared
her a deal of bitter sorrow by taking her away. My! It does bring it
all back to me so&mdash;the house and the yard, and all. We'd all got
used to seeing it a ruin; and now&mdash; Whatever put it in your
head, dearie, to want things put back just as they were? Papa was
telling me this morning you was all for restoring the place. He
thinks 'twould be more stylish and up-to-date if you was to put
new-style paper on the walls, and let him furnish it up for you with
nice golden oak. Henry's got real good taste. You'd ought to see our
sideboard he gave me Chris'mas, with a mirror and all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having thus discharged her wifely duty, as it appeared to her,
Mrs. Daggett promptly turned her back upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you don't want any golden oak sideboards and like that
in this house. Henry was telling me all about it, and how you were
set on getting back the old Bolton furniture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I could?&rdquo; asked the girl eagerly.
&ldquo;It was all sold about here, wasn't it? And don't you think if
I was willing to pay a great deal for it people
would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Course they would!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Daggett, with
cheerful assurance. &ldquo;They'd be tickled half to death to get
money for it. But, you see, dearie, it's a long time ago, and some
folks have moved away, and there's been two or three fires, and I
suppose some are not as careful as others; still&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The smile faded on the girl's lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can get some of it back; don't you think I can?
I&mdash;I've quite set my heart on&mdash;restoring the house. I want
it just as it used to be. The old furniture would suit the house so
much better; don't you think it would?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett clapped her plump hands excitedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've just thought of a way!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;And I'll bet it'll work, too. You know Henry he keeps th' post
office; an' 'most everybody for miles around comes after their mail
to th' store. I'll tell him to put up a sign, right where everybody
will see; something like this: &lsquo;Miss Lydia Orr wants to buy the
old furniture of the Bolton house.&rsquo;  And you might mention
casual you'd pay good prices for it. 'Twas real good, solid
furniture, I remember.... Come to think of it, Mrs. Bolton collected
quite a lot of it right 'round here. She was a city girl when she
married Andrew Bolton, an' she took a great interest in queer old
things. She bought a big tall clock out of somebody's attic, and
four-posted beds, the kind folks used to sleep in, an' outlandish old
cracked china plates with scenes on 'em. I recollect I gave her a
blue and white teapot, with an eagle on the side that belonged to my
grandmother. She thought it was perfectly elegant, and kept it full
of rose-leaves and spice on the parlor mantelpiece. Land! I hadn't
thought of that teapot for years and years. I don't know whatever
became of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sound of planes and hammers filled the silence that followed.
Lydia was standing by the tall carved chair, her eyes downcast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm glad you thought of&mdash;that notice,&rdquo; she said
at last. &ldquo;If Mr. Daggett will see to it for me&mdash;I'll stop
at the office tomorrow. And now, if you have time, I'd so like you to
go over the house with me. You can tell me about the wall papers
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett arose with cheerful alacrity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd like nothing better,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I
ain't been in the house for so long. Last time was the day of the
auction; 'twas after they took the little girl away, I remember....
Oh, didn't nobody tell you? There was one child&mdash;a real, nice
little girl. I forget her name; Mrs. Bolton used to call her Baby and
Darling and like that. She was an awful pretty little girl, about as
old as my Nellie. I've often wondered what became of her. Some of her
relatives took her away, after her mother was buried. Poor little
thing&mdash;her ma dead an' her pa shut up in prison&mdash;... Oh!
yes; this was the parlor.... My! to think how the years have gone by,
and me as slim as a match then. Now that's what I call a handsome
mantel; and ain't the marble kept real pretty? There was all-colored
rugs and a waxed floor in here, and a real old-fashioned sofa in that
corner and a mahogany table with carved legs over here, and long lace
curtains at the windows. I see they've fixed the ceilings as good as
new and scraped all the old paper off the walls. There used to be
some sort of patterned paper in here. I can't seem to think what
color it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found quite a fresh piece behind the door,&rdquo; said
Lydia. &ldquo;See; I've put all the good pieces from the different
rooms together, and marked them. I was wondering if Mr. Daggett could
go to Boston for me? I'm sure he could match the papers there. You
could go, too, if you cared to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Boston!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Daggett; &ldquo;me and
Henry? Why, Miss Orr, what an idea! But Henry couldn't no more leave
the post office&mdash;he ain't never left it a day since he was
appointed postmaster. My, no! 'twouldn't do for Henry to take a trip
clear to Boston. And me&mdash;I'm so busy I'd be like a fly trying t'
get off sticky paper.... I do hate to see 'em struggle,
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She followed the girl up the broad stair, once more safe and firm,
talking steadily all the way.</p>

<p>There were four large chambers, their windows framing lovely
vistas of stream and wood and meadow, with the distant blue of the
far horizon melting into the summer sky. Mrs. Daggett stopped in the
middle of the wide hall and looked about her wonderingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;You certainly did
show good sense in buying this old house. They don't build them this
way now-a-days. That's what I said to Mrs. Deacon Whittle&mdash; You
know some folks thought you were kind of foolish not to buy Mrs.
Solomon Black's house down in the village. But if you're going to
live here all alone, dearie, ain't it going to be kind of
lonesome&mdash;all these big rooms for a little body like
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it, please,&rdquo; begged Lydia.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I've been wondering which room was his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean Andrew Bolton's, I s'pose,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Daggett reluctantly. &ldquo;But I hope you won't worry any over what
folks tells you about the day he was taken away. My! seems as if
'twas yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She moved softly into one of the spacious, sunny rooms and stood
looking about her, as if her eyes beheld once more the tragedy long
since folded into the past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't going to tell you anything sad,&rdquo; she said
under her breath. &ldquo;It's best forgot. This was their room; ain't
it nice an' cheerful? I like a southwest room myself. And 'tain't a
bit warm here, what with the breeze sweeping in at the four big
windows and smelling sweet of clover an' locust blooms. And ain't it
lucky them trees didn't get blown over last winter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned abruptly toward the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was you thinking of sleeping in this room, dearie? It used
to have blue and white paper on it, and white paint as fresh as milk.
It'd be nice and pleasant for a young lady, I should
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;if it was <em>his</em>
room. I think I'd rather&mdash;which was the little girl's room? You
said there was a child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I'm real sorry you feel that way,&rdquo; sympathized
Mrs. Daggett, &ldquo;but I don't know as I blame you, the way folks
talk. You'd think they'd have forgot all about it by now, wouldn't
you? But land! it does seem as if bad thoughts and mean thoughts, and
like that, was possessed to fasten right on to folks; and you can't
seem to shake 'em off, no more than them spiteful little stick-tights
that get all over your clo'es.... This room right next belonged to
their baby. Let me see; she must have been about three and a half or
four years old when they took her away. See, there's a door in
between, so Mrs. Bolton could get to her quick in the night. I used
to be that way, too, with my children.... You know we lost our two
little girls that same winter, three and five, they were. But I know
I wanted 'em right where I could hear 'em if they asked for a drink
of water, or like that, in the night. Folks has a great notion
now-a-days of putting their babies off by themselves and letting them
cry it out, as they say. But I couldn't ever do that; and Mrs. Andrew
Bolton she wa'n't that kind of a parent, either&mdash; I don't know
as they ought to be called <em>mothers</em>. No, she was more like
me&mdash;liked to tuck the blankets around her baby in the middle of
th' night an' pat her down all warm and nice. I've often wondered
what became of that poor little orphan child. We never heard. Like
enough she died. I shouldn't wonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Mrs. Daggett wiped the ready tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I guess you'll think I'm a real old Aunty Doleful,
going on this way,&rdquo; she made haste to add.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's plenty of folks in Brookville as 'll tell you how
stuck-up an' stylish Mrs. Andrew Bolton was, always dressed in silk
of an afternoon and driving out with a two-horse team, an' keeping
two hired girls constant, besides a man to work in her flower garden
and another for the barn. But of course she supposed they were really
rich and could afford it. <em>He</em> never let on to <em>her</em>,
after things begun to go to pieces; and folks blamed her for it,
afterwards. Her heart was weak, and he knew it, all along. And then I
suppose he thought mebbe things would take a turn.... Yes; the paper
in this room was white with little wreaths of pink roses tied up with
blue ribbons all over it. 'Twas furnished up real pretty with white
furniture, and there was ruffled muslin curtains with dots on 'em at
the windows and over the bed; Mrs. Andrew Bolton certainly did fix
things up pretty, and to think you're going to have it just the same
way. Well, I will say you couldn't do any better.... But, land! if
there isn't the sun going down behind the hill, and me way out here,
with Henry's supper to get, and Dolly champing his bit impatient.
There's one lucky thing, though; he'll travel good, going towards
home; he won't stop to get his tail over the lines,
neither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An hour later, when the long summer twilight was deepening into
gloom, Jim Dodge crossed the empty library and paused at the open
door of the room beyond. The somber light from the two tall windows
fell upon the figure of the girl. She was sitting before Andrew
Bolton's desk, her head upon her folded arms. Something in the
spiritless droop of her shoulders and the soft dishevelment of her
fair hair suggested weariness&mdash;sleep, perhaps. But as the young
man hesitated on the threshold the sound of a muffled sob escaped the
quiet figure. He turned noiselessly and went away, sorry and ashamed,
because unwittingly he had stumbled upon the clew he had long been
seeking.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XI</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Beside this stone wall I want flowers,&rdquo; Lydia was
saying to her landscape-gardener, as she persisted in calling Jim
Dodge. &ldquo;Hollyhocks and foxgloves and pinies&mdash;I shall never
say peony in Brookville&mdash;and pansies, sweet williams, lads'
love, iris and sweetbrier. Mrs. Daggett has promised to give me some
roots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He avoided her eyes as she faced him in the bright glow of the
morning sunlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Miss Orr,&rdquo; he said, with cold respect.
&ldquo;You want a border here about four feet wide, filled with
old-fashioned perennials.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had been diligent in his study of the books she had supplied
him with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A herbaceous border of that sort in front of the stone wall
will give quite the latest effect in country-house decoration,&rdquo;
he went on professionally. &ldquo;Ramblers of various colors might be
planted at the back, and there should be a mixture of bulbs among the
taller plants to give color in early spring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She listened doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know about the ramblers,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Were there ramblers&mdash;twenty years ago? I want it as
nearly as possible just as it was. Mrs. Daggett told me yesterday
about the flower-border here. You&mdash;of course you don't remember
the place at all; do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reddened slightly under her intent gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I remember something about it,&rdquo; he told her;
&ldquo;the garden was a long time going down. There were flowers here
a few years back; but the grass and weeds got the better of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you&mdash;remember the Boltons?&rdquo; she
persisted. &ldquo;I was so interested in what Mrs. Daggett told me
about the family yesterday. It seems strange to think no one has
lived here since. And now that I&mdash;it is to be my home, I can't
help thinking about them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have built a new house,&rdquo; said Jim Dodge.
&ldquo;A new house would have been better and cheaper, in the
end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thrust his spade deep, a sign that he considered the
conversation at an end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell one of the other men to dig this,&rdquo; she objected.
&ldquo;I want to make a list of the plants we need and get the order
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do that tonight, Miss Orr,&rdquo; he returned, going
on with his digging. &ldquo;The men are busy in the orchards this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want me to go away,&rdquo; she inferred swiftly.</p>

<p>He flung down his spade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is certainly up to me to obey orders,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Pardon me, if I seem to have forgotten the fact. Shall we make
the list now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inwardly he was cursing himself for his stupidity. Perhaps he had
been mistaken the night before. His fancy had taken a swift leap in
the dark and landed&mdash;where? There was a sort of scornful honesty
in Jim Dodge's nature which despised all manner of shams and petty
deceits. His code also included a strict minding of his own business.
He told himself rather sharply that he was a fool for suspecting that
Lydia Orr was other than she had represented herself to be. She had
been crying the night before. What of that? Other girls cried over
night and smiled the next morning&mdash;his sister Fanny, for
example. It was an inexplicable habit of women. His mother had once
told him, rather vaguely, that it did her good to have a regular
crying-spell. It relieved her nerves, she said, and sort of braced
her up....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I didn't mean that,&rdquo; Lydia was at some
pains to explain, as the two walked toward the veranda where there
were chairs and a table.</p>

<p>She was looking fair and dainty in a gown of some thin white
stuff, through which her neck and arms showed slenderly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's too warm to dig in the ground this morning,&rdquo; she
decided. &ldquo;And anyway, planning the work is far more
important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Than doing it?&rdquo; he asked quizzically. &ldquo;If we'd
done nothing but plan all this; why you see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made a large gesture which included the carpenters at work on
the roof, painters perilously poised on tall ladders and a half dozen
men busy spraying the renovated orchards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she returned with a smile, &ldquo;&mdash;now
that you've so kindly pointed it out to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leveled a keen glance at her. It was impossible not to see her
this morning in the light of what he thought he had discovered the
night before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've done nothing but make plans all my life,&rdquo; she
went on gravely. &ldquo;Ever since I can remember I've been
thinking&mdash;thinking and planning what I should do when I grew up.
It seemed such a long, long time&mdash;being just a little girl, I
mean, and not able to do what I wished. But I kept on thinking and
planning, and all the while I <em>was</em> growing up; and then at
last&mdash;it all happened as I wished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She appeared to wait for his question. But he remained silent,
staring at the blue rim of distant hills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't ask me&mdash;you don't seem to care what I was
planning,&rdquo; she said, her voice timid and uncertain.</p>

<p>He glanced quickly at her. Something in her look stirred him
curiously. It did not occur to him that her appeal and his instant
response to it were as old as the race.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would tell me,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Tell me
everything!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath, her eyes misty with dreams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a long time I taught school,&rdquo; she went on,
&ldquo;but I couldn't save enough that way. I never could have saved
enough, even if I had lived on bread and water. I wanted&mdash;I
needed a great deal of money, and I wasn't clever nor particularly
well educated. Sometimes I thought if I could only marry a
millionaire&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared at her incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't mean that,&rdquo; he said with some
impatience.</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm telling you just what happened,&rdquo; she reminded
him. &ldquo;It seemed the only way to get what I wanted. I thought I
shouldn't mind that, or&mdash;anything, if I could only have as much
money as I needed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sense of sudden violent anger flared up within him. Did the girl
realize what she was saying?</p>

<p>She glanced up at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never meant to tell any one about that part of it,&rdquo;
she said hurriedly. &ldquo;And&mdash;it wasn't necessary, after all;
I got the money another way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bit off the point of a pencil he had been sharpening with
laborious care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should probably never have had a chance to marry a
millionaire,&rdquo; she concluded reminiscently. &ldquo;I'm not
beautiful enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With what abominable clearness she understood the game: the
marriage-market; the buyer and the price.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;didn't suppose you were like that,&rdquo; he
muttered, after what seemed a long silence.</p>

<p>She seemed faintly surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you don't know me,&rdquo; she said quickly.
&ldquo;Does any man know any woman, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They think they do,&rdquo; he stated doggedly; &ldquo;and
that amounts to the same thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His thoughts reverted for an uncomfortable instant to Wesley
Elliot and Fanny. It was only too easy to see through Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of them are simple souls, and thank heaven for
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His tone was fervently censorious.</p>

<p>She smiled understandingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I ought to tell you further that a rich
man&mdash;not a millionaire; but rich enough&mdash;actually did ask
me to marry him, and I refused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H'mph!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added calmly, &ldquo;I think I should have
married him, if I had not had money left me first&mdash;before he
asked me, I mean. I knew all along that what I had determined to do,
I could do best alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared at her from under gathered brows. He still felt that
curious mixture of shame and anger burning hotly within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just why are you telling me all this?&rdquo; he demanded
roughly.</p>

<p>She returned his look quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have been trying to
guess my secret for a long time and you have succeeded; haven't
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was speechless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been wondering about me, all along. I could see
that, of course. I suppose everybody in Brookville has been wondering
and&mdash;and talking. I meant to be frank and open about it&mdash;to
tell right out who I was and what I came to do.
But&mdash;somehow&mdash;I couldn't.... It didn't seem possible, when
everybody&mdash;you see I thought it all happened so long ago people
would have forgotten. I supposed they would be just glad to get their
money back. I meant to give it to them&mdash;all, every dollar of it.
I didn't care if it took all I had.... And then&mdash;I heard you
last night when you crossed the library. I hoped&mdash;you would ask
me why&mdash;but you didn't. I thought, first, of telling Mrs.
Daggett; she is a kind soul. I had to tell someone, because he is
coming home soon, and I may need&mdash;help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes were solemn, beseeching, compelling.</p>

<p>His anger died suddenly, leaving only a sort of indignant pity for
her unfriended youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are&mdash;&rdquo; he began, then stopped short. A
painter was swiftly descending his ladder, whistling as he came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; she said, without appearing to notice,
&ldquo;is Lydia Orr Bolton. No one seems to remember&mdash;perhaps
they didn't know my mother's name was Orr. My uncle took me away from
here. I was only a baby. It seemed best to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo; he asked guardedly.</p>

<p>The painter had disappeared behind the house. But he could hear
heavy steps on the roof over their heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both are dead,&rdquo; she replied briefly. &ldquo;No one
knew my uncle had much money; we lived quite simply and
unpretentiously in South Boston. They never told me about the money;
and all those years I was praying for it! Well, it came to
me&mdash;in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes asked a pitying question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I knew about father.
They used to take me to visit him in the prison. Of course I didn't
understand, at first. But gradually, as I grew older, I began to
realize what had happened&mdash;to him and to me. It was then I began
to make plans. He would be free, sometime; he would need a home. Once
he tried to escape, with some other men. A guard shot my father; he
was in the prison-hospital a long time. They let me see him then
without bars between, because they were sure he would die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God's sake,&rdquo; he interrupted hoarsely. &ldquo;Was
there no one&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was after my aunt died: I went alone. They watched me
closely at first; but afterward they were kinder. He used to talk
about home&mdash;always about home. He meant this house, I found. It
was then I made up my mind to do anything to get the money.... You
see I knew he could never be happy here unless the old wrongs were
righted first. I saw I must do all that; and when, after my uncle's
death, I found that I was rich&mdash;really rich, I came here as soon
as I could. There wasn't any time to lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She fell silent, her eyes shining luminously under half closed
lids. She seemed unconscious of his gaze riveted upon her face. It
was as if a curtain had been drawn aside by her painful effort. He
was seeing her clearly now and without cloud of passion&mdash;in all
her innocence, her sadness, set sacredly apart from other women by
the long devotion of her thwarted youth. An immense compassion took
possession of him. He could have fallen at her feet praying her
forgiveness for his mean suspicions, his harsh judgment.</p>

<p>The sound of hammers on the veranda roof above their heads
appeared to rouse her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you think I ought to tell&mdash;everybody?&rdquo; she
asked hurriedly.</p>

<p>He considered her question in silence for a moment. The bitterness
against Andrew Bolton had grown and strengthened with the years into
something rigid, inexorable. Since early boyhood he had grown
accustomed to the harsh, unrelenting criticisms, the brutal epithets
applied to this man who had been trusted with money and had
defaulted. Even children, born long after the failure, reviled the
name of the man who had made their hard lot harder. It had been the
juvenile custom to throw stones at the house he had lived in. He
remembered with fresh shame the impish glee with which, in company
with other boys of his own age, he had trampled the few surviving
flowers and broken down the shrubs in the garden. The hatred of
Bolton, like some malignant growth, had waxed monstrous from what it
preyed upon, ruining and distorting the simple kindly life of the
village. She was waiting for his answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would seem so much more honest,&rdquo; she said in a
tired voice. &ldquo;Now they can only think me eccentric, foolishly
extravagant, lavishly generous&mdash;when I am trying&mdash; I didn't
dare to ask Deacon Whittle or Judge Fulsom for a list of the
creditors, so I paid a large sum&mdash;far more than they would have
asked&mdash;for the house. And since then I have bought the old bank
building. I should like to make a library there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; he said huskily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the furniture&mdash;I shall pay a great deal for that.
I want the house to look just as it used to, when father comes home.
You see he had an additional sentence for trying to escape and for
conspiracy; and since then his mind&mdash;he doesn't seem to remember
everything. Sometimes he calls me Margaret. He thinks I
am&mdash;mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice faltered a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn't tell them,&rdquo; he said vehemently.
&ldquo;You mustn't!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He saw with terrible clearness what it would be like: the
home-coming of the half-imbecile criminal, and the staring eyes, the
pointing fingers of all Brookville leveled at him. She would be
overborne by the shame of it all&mdash;trampled like a flower in the
mire.</p>

<p>She seemed faintly disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I would far rather tell,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;I
have had so much to conceal&mdash;all my life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flung out her hands in a gesture of utter weariness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was never allowed to mention father to anyone,&rdquo; she
went on. &ldquo;My aunt was always pointing out what a terrible thing
it would be for any one to find out&mdash;who I was. She didn't want
me to know; but uncle insisted. I think he was sorry
for&mdash;father.... Oh, you don't know what it is like to be in
prison for years&mdash;to have all the manhood squeezed out of one,
drop by drop! I think if it hadn't been for me he would have died
long ago. I used to pretend I was very gay and happy when I went to
see him. He wanted me to be like that. It pleased him to think my
life had not been clouded by what he called his <em>mistake</em>....
He didn't intend to wreck the bank, Mr. Dodge. He thought he was
going to make the village rich and prosperous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She leaned forward. &ldquo;I have learned to smile during all
these years. But now, I want to tell everybody&mdash;I long to be
free from pretending! Can't you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something big and round in his throat hurt him so that he could
not answer at once. He clenched his hands, enraged by the futility of
his pity for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Daggett seems a kind soul,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;She would be my friend. I am sure of it. But&mdash;the
others&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used to fancy how they would all come to the station to
meet him&mdash;after I had paid everybody, I mean&mdash;how they
would crowd about him and take his hand and tell him they were glad
it was all over; then I would bring him home, and he would never even
guess it had stood desolate during all these years. He has forgotten
so much already; but he remembers home&mdash;oh, quite perfectly. I
went to see him last week, and he spoke of the gardens and orchards.
That is how I knew how to have things planted: he told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got hastily to his feet: her look, her voice&mdash;the useless
smart of it all was swiftly growing unbearable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must wait&mdash;I must think!&rdquo; he said
unsteadily. &ldquo;You ought not to have told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I should have told the minister,
instead?&rdquo; she asked rather piteously. &ldquo;He has been very
kind; but somehow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Wesley Elliot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face darkened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven you did not tell him! I am at least
no&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He checked himself with an effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;You&mdash;you mustn't
speak to any one of what you have told me&mdash;not for the present,
anyway. I want you to promise me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her slight figure sagged wearily against the back of her chair.
She was looking up at him like a child spent with an unavailing
passion of grief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have promised that so many times,&rdquo; she murmured:
&ldquo;I have concealed everything so long&mdash;it will be easier
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be easier for you,&rdquo; he agreed quickly;
&ldquo;and&mdash;perhaps better, on the whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they will not know they are being paid&mdash;they won't
understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That makes no difference,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;It
would make them, perhaps, less contented to know where the money was
coming from. Tell me, does your servant&mdash;this woman you brought
from Boston; does she know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean Martha? I&mdash;I'm not sure. She was a servant in
my uncle's home for years. She wanted to live with me, so I sent for
her. I never spoke to her about&mdash;father. She seems devoted to
me. I have thought it would be necessary to tell
her&mdash;before&mdash; He is coming in September. Everything will be
finished by then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed blankly on the hedge; something&mdash;a
horse's ears, perhaps&mdash;was bobbing slowly up and down; a faint
rattle of wheels came to their ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't tell anyone, yet,&rdquo; he urged, and stepped down
from the veranda, his unseeing gaze still fixed upon the slow advance
of those bobbing ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone is coming,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>He glanced at her, marveling at the swift transition in her face.
A moment before she had been listless, sad, disheartened by his
apparent disapproval of her plans. Now all at once the cloud had
vanished; she was once more cheerful, calm, even smiling.</p>

<p>She too had been looking and had at once recognized the four
persons seated in the shabby old carryall which at that moment turned
in at the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am to have visitors,&rdquo; she said tranquilly.</p>

<p>His eyes reluctantly followed hers. There were four women in the
approaching vehicle.</p>

<p>As on another occasion, the young man beat a swift retreat.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XII</h4>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I don't know what you'll think of us gadding
about in the morning so,&rdquo; began Mrs. Dix, as she caught sight
of Lydia.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dix was sitting in the back seat of the carryall with Mrs.
Dodge. The two girls were in front. Lydia noticed mechanically that
both were freshly gowned in white and that Fanny, who was driving,
eyed her with haughty reserve from under the brim of her flower-laden
hat. Ellen Dix had turned her head to gaze after Jim Dodge's
retreating figure; her eyes returned to Lydia with an expression of
sulky reluctance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm so glad to see you,&rdquo; said Lydia. &ldquo;Won't you
come in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dodge. &ldquo;Jim has
been telling us about the improvements, all along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly does look nice,&rdquo; chimed in Mrs. Dix.
&ldquo;I wouldn't have believed it possible, in such a little time,
too. Just cramp that wheel a little more, Fanny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two older women descended from the carryall and began looking
eagerly around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just see how nice the grass looks,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dodge.
&ldquo;And the flowers! My! I didn't suppose Jim was that smart at
fixing things up.... Aren't you going to get out, girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls still sat on the high front seat of the carryall;
both were gazing at Lydia in her simple morning frock. There were no
flowers on Lydia's Panama hat; nothing but a plain black band; but it
had an air of style and elegance. Fanny was wishing she had bought a
plain hat without roses. Ellen tossed her dark head:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You aren't going to
stay long; are you, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For pity sake, Ellen!&rdquo; expostulated Mrs. Dodge
briskly. &ldquo;Of course you'll get out, and you, too, Fanny. The
horse'll stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please do!&rdquo; entreated Lydia.</p>

<p>Thus urged, the girls reluctantly descended. Neither was in the
habit of concealing her feelings under the convenient cloak of
society observance, and both were jealously suspicious of Lydia Orr.
Fanny had met her only the week before, walking with Wesley Elliot
along the village street. And Mrs. Solomon Black had told Mrs.
Fulsom, and Mrs. Fulsom had told Mrs. Deacon Whittle, and Mrs.
Whittle had told another woman, who had felt it to be her Christian
duty (however unpleasant) to inform Fanny that the minister was
&ldquo;payin' attention to Miss Orr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the woman had pointed out, &ldquo;it
wasn't to be wondered at, special, seeing the Orr girl had every
chance in the world to catch him&mdash;living right in the same house
with him.&rdquo;  Then she had further stated her opinions of men in
general for Fanny's benefit. All persons of the male sex, according
to this woman, were easily put upon, deceived and otherwise led
astray by artful young women from the city, who were represented as
perpetually on the lookout for easy marks, like Wesley Elliot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ain't any different from other men, if he <em>is</em> a
minister,&rdquo; said she with a comprehensive sniff. &ldquo;They're
all alike, as far as I can find out: anybody that's a mind to
soft-soap them and flatter them into thinkin' they're something great
can lead them right around by the nose. And besides, <em>she's</em>
got <em>money!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny had affected a haughty indifference to the doings of Wesley
Elliot, which did not for a moment deceive her keen-eyed
informer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, anybody with eyes in their heads can see what's
taken place,&rdquo; compassionated she, impaling the unfortunate
Fanny on the prongs of her sympathy. &ldquo;My! I was telling George
only yesterday, I thought it was a <em>perfect shame!</em> and
somebody ought to speak out real plain to the minister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereat Fanny had been goaded into wishing the woman would mind
her own business! She did wish everybody would leave her and her
affairs alone! People had no right to talk! As for speaking to the
minister; let any one dare&mdash;!</p>

<p>As for Ellen Dix, she had never quite forgiven Lydia for
innocently acquiring the fox skin and she had by now almost persuaded
herself that she was passionately in love with Jim Dodge. She had
always liked him&mdash;at least, she had not actively disliked him,
as some of the other girls professed to do. She had found his
satirical tongue, his keen eyes and his real or affected indifference
to feminine wiles pleasantly stimulating. There was some fun in
talking to Jim Dodge. But of late she had not been afforded the
opportunity. Fanny had explained to Ellen that Jim was working
terribly hard, often rising at three and four in the morning to work
on his own farm, and putting in long days at the Bolton place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She seems to have most of the men in Brookville doing for
her,&rdquo; Ellen had remarked coldly.</p>

<p>Then the girls had exchanged cautious glances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's something awfully funny about her coming here,
anyway,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;Everybody thinks it's
queer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect she had a reason,&rdquo; said Fanny, avoiding
Ellen's eyes.</p>

<p>After which brief interchange of opinion they had twined their
arms about each other's waists and squeezed wordless understanding
and sympathy. Henceforth, it was tacitly understood between the two
girls that singly and collectively they did not &ldquo;like&rdquo;
Lydia Orr.</p>

<p>Lydia understood without further explanation that she was not to
look to her nearest neighbors for either friendship or the affection
she so deeply craved. Both Ellen and Fanny had passed the place every
day since its restoration began; but not once had either betrayed the
slightest interest or curiosity in what was going on beyond the
barrier of the hedge. To be sure, Fanny had once stopped to speak to
her brother; but when Lydia had hurried hopefully out to greet her it
was only to catch a glimpse of the girl's back as she walked quickly
away.</p>

<p>Jim Dodge had explained, with some awkwardness, that Fanny was in
a hurry....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I'll tell you, Miss Orr,&rdquo; Mrs. Dix was
saying, as all five women walked slowly toward the house. &ldquo;I
was talking with Abby Daggett, and she was telling me about your
wanting to get back the old furniture that used to be in the house.
It seems Henry Daggett has put up a notice in the post office; but so
far, he says, not very many pieces have been heard from. You know the
men-folks generally go after the mail, and men are slow; there's no
denying that. As like as not they haven't even mentioned seeing the
notice to the folks at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; confirmed Mrs. Dodge, nodding her head.
&ldquo;I don't know as Jim would ever tell us anything that happened
from morning till night. We just have to pump things out of him;
don't we, Fanny? He'd never tell without we did. His father was just
the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny looked annoyed, and Ellen squeezed her arm with an amused
giggle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't know, mother, there was anything we wanted to
know, particularly,&rdquo; she said coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know both of us have been real interested in the
work here,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Dodge, wonderingly. &ldquo;I
remember you was asking Jim only last night if Miss Orr was really
going to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you'll like to see the house,&rdquo; said Lydia, as
if she had not heard; &ldquo;of course, being here every day I don't
notice the changes as you might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You aren't living here yet, are you?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Dix.
&ldquo;I understood Mrs. Solomon Black to say you weren't going to
leave her for awhile yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I shall be there nights and Sundays till everything is
finished here,&rdquo; said Lydia. &ldquo;Mrs. Black makes me very
comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think most of us ladies had ought to give you a
vote of thanks on account of feeding the men-folks, noons,&rdquo; put
in Mrs. Dodge. &ldquo;It saves a lot of time not to have to look
after a dinner-pail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; interrupted Fanny in a thin, sharp voice,
quite unlike her own, &ldquo;you know Jim always comes home to his
dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what if he does; I was speaking for the rest of th'
women,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dodge. &ldquo;I'm sure it's very kind of Miss
Orr to think of such a thing as cooking a hot dinner for all those
hungry men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dodge had received a second check from the assignees that
very morning from the sale of the old bank building, and she was
proportionately cheerful and content.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; if this isn't handsome!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Dix,
pausing in the hall to look about her. &ldquo;I declare I'd forgotten
how it used to look. This is certainly better than having an old ruin
standing here. But, of course it brings back old days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sighed, her dark, comely face clouding with sorrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she went on, turning confidentially to
Lydia, &ldquo;that dreadful bank failure was the real cause of my
poor husband's death. He never held up his head after that. They
suspected at first he was implicated in the steal. But Mr. Dix wasn't
anything like Andrew Bolton. No; indeed! He wouldn't have taken a
cent that belonged to anybody else&mdash;not if he was to die for
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; confirmed Mrs. Dodge. &ldquo;What Andrew
Bolton got was altogether too good for him. Come right down to it, he
wasn't no better than a murderer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she nodded her head emphatically.</p>

<p>Fanny and Ellen, who stood looking on, reddened impatiently at
this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sick and tired of hearing about Andrew Bolton,&rdquo;
complained Ellen. &ldquo;I've heard nothing else since I can
remember. It's a pity you bought this house, Miss Orr: I heard Mr.
Elliot say it was like stirring up a horrid, muddy pool. Not very
complimentary to Brookville; but then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you think people will&mdash;forget after a
while?&rdquo; asked Lydia, her blue eyes fixed appealingly on the two
young faces. &ldquo;I don't see why everybody
should&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you'd fixed the house entirely different,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Dix. &ldquo;But having it put back, just as it was, and
wanting the old furniture and all&mdash;whatever put that into your
head, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard it was handsome and old&mdash;I like old things.
And, of course, it was&mdash;more in keeping to restore the house as
it was, than to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I s'pose that's so,&rdquo; conceded Mrs. Dodge, her
quick dark eyes busy with the renovated interior. &ldquo;I'd sort of
forgot how it did look when the Boltons was livin' here. But speaking
of furniture; I see Mrs. Judge Fulsom let you have the old sofa. I
remember she got it at the auction; she's kept it in her parlor ever
since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lydia. &ldquo;I was only too happy to give
a hundred dollars for the sofa. It has been excellently
preserved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hundred dollars!&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Dix.
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dodge giggled excitedly, like a young girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hundred dollars!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Well, I want
to know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two women exchanged swift glances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn't want to buy any pieces that had been broke, I
s'pose,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Dodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they can be repaired, I certainly do,&rdquo; replied
Lydia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; expostulated Fanny, in a low but urgent
tone. &ldquo;Ellen and I&mdash;we really ought to be
going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl's face glowed with shamed crimson. She felt haughty and
humiliated and angry all at once. It was not to be borne.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dix was not listening to Fanny Dodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bid in the big, four-post mahogany bed at the
auction,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and the bureau to match; an' I
believe there are two or three chairs about the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We've got a table,&rdquo; chimed in Mrs. Dodge; &ldquo;but
one leg give away, an' I had it put up in the attic years ago. And
Fanny's got a bed and bureau in her room that was painted white, with
little pink flowers tied up with blue ribbons. Of course the paint is
pretty well rubbed off; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, might I have that set?&rdquo; cried Lydia, turning to
Fanny. &ldquo;Perhaps you've grown fond of it and won't want to give
it up. But I&mdash;I'd pay almost anything for it. And of course I
shall want the mahogany, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we didn't know,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Dix, with
dignity. &ldquo;We got those pieces instead of the money we'd ought
to have had from the estate. There was a big crowd at the auction, I
remember; but nobody really wanted to pay anything for the old
furniture. A good deal of it had come out of folks' attics in the
first place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad to pay three hundred dollars for the
mahogany bed and bureau,&rdquo; said Lydia. &ldquo;And for the little
white set&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't care to part with my furniture,&rdquo; said Fanny
Dodge, her pretty round chin uplifted.</p>

<p>She was taller than Lydia, and appeared to be looking over her
head with an intent stare at the freshly papered wall beyond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For pity sake!&rdquo; exclaimed her mother sharply.
&ldquo;Why, Fanny, you could buy a brand new set, an' goodness knows
what-all with the money. What's the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know just how Fanny feels about having her room
changed,&rdquo; put in Ellen Dix, with a spirited glance at the
common enemy. &ldquo;There are things that money can't buy, but some
people don't seem to think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia's blue eyes had clouded swiftly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you'll come into the library,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;we'll have some lemonade. It's so very warm I'm sure we are
all thirsty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not speak of the furniture again, and after a little the
visitors rose to go. Mrs. Dodge lingered behind the others to
whisper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sure I don't know what got into my Fanny. Only the
other day she was wishing she might have her room done over, with new
furniture and all. I'll try and coax her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Lydia shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don't,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want that furniture
very much; but&mdash;I know there are things money can't
buy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe you wouldn't want it, if you was t' see it,&rdquo;
was Mrs. Dodge's honest opinion. &ldquo;It's all turned yellow, an'
the pink flowers are mostly rubbed off. I remember it was real pretty
when we first got it. It used to belong to Mrs. Bolton's little girl.
I don't know as anybody's told you, but they had a little girl. My!
what an awful thing for a child to grow up to! I've often thought of
it. But mebbe she didn't live to grow up. None of us ever
heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; called Fanny, from the front seat of the
carryall. &ldquo;We're waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a minute, Fanny,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dodge.... &ldquo;Of
course you can have that table I spoke of, Miss Orr, and anything
else I can find in the attic, or around. An' I was thinking if you
was to come down to the Ladies' Aid on Friday afternoon&mdash;it
meets at Mrs. Mixter's this week, at two o'clock; you know where Mrs.
Mixter lives, don't you? Well; anyway, Mrs. Solomon Black does, an'
she generally comes. But I know lots of the ladies has pieces of that
furniture; and most of them would be mighty glad to get rid of it.
But they are like my Fanny&mdash;kind of contrary, and backward about
selling things. I'll talk to Fanny when we get home. Why, she don't
any more want that old painted set&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;  Fanny's sweet angry voice halted the rapid
progress of her mother's speech for an instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn't wonder if the flies was bothering th'
horse,&rdquo; surmised Mrs. Dodge; &ldquo;he does fidget an' stamp
somethin' terrible when the flies gets after him; his tail ain't so
long as some.... Well, I'll let you know; and if you could drop
around and see the table and all&mdash; Yes, some day this week. Of
course I'll have to buy new furniture to put in their places; so will
Mrs. Dix. But I will say that mahogany bed is handsome; they've got
it in their spare room, and there ain't a scratch on it. I can
guarantee that.... Yes; I guess the flies are bad today; looks like
rain. Good-by!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia stood watching the carryall, as it moved away from under the
milk-white pillars of the restored portico. Why did Fanny Dodge and
Ellen Dix dislike her, she wondered, and what could she do to win
their friendship? Her troubled thoughts were interrupted by Martha,
the taciturn maid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found this picture on the floor, Miss Lydia,&rdquo; said
Martha; &ldquo;did you drop it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia glanced at the small, unmounted photograph. It was a faded
snapshot of a picnic party under a big tree. Her eyes became at once
riveted upon the central figures of the little group; the pretty girl
in the middle was Fanny Dodge; and behind her&mdash;yes, surely, that
was the young clergyman, Wesley Elliot. Something in the attitude of
the man and the coquettish upward tilt of the girl's face brought
back to her mind a forgotten remark of Mrs. Solomon Black's. Lydia
had failed to properly understand it, at the time. Mrs. Solomon Black
was given to cryptic remarks, and Lydia's mind had been preoccupied
by the increasing difficulties which threatened the accomplishment of
her purpose:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A person, coming into a town like Brookville to live, by
rights had ought to have eyes in the backs of their heads,&rdquo;
Mrs. Black had observed.</p>

<p>It was at breakfast time, Lydia now remembered, and the minister
was late, as frequently happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought like's not nobody would mention it to you,&rdquo;
Mrs. Black had further elucidated. &ldquo;Of course <em>he</em>
wouldn't say anything, men-folks are kind of sly and secret in their
doings&mdash;even the best of 'em; and you'll find it's so, as you
travel along life's path-way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Black had once written a piece of poetry and it had actually
been printed in the Grenoble <i>News</i>; since then she frequently
made use of figures of speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A married woman and a widow can speak from
experience,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;So I thought I'd just tell
you: he's as good as engaged, already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean Mr. Elliot?&rdquo; asked Lydia incuriously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Black nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you ought to know,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Mr. Elliot had entered the room upon the heels of this warning,
and Lydia had promptly forgotten it. Now she paused for a swift
review of the weeks which had already passed since her arrival. Mr.
Elliot had been unobtrusively kind and helpful from the first, she
remembered. Later, he had been indefatigable in the matter of
securing workmen for the restoration of the old house, when she made
it clear to him that she did not want an architect and preferred to
hire Brookville men exclusively. As seemed entirely natural, the
minister had called frequently to inspect the progress of the work.
Twice in their rounds together they had come upon Jim Dodge; and
although the clergyman was affable in his recognition and greeting,
Lydia had been unpleasantly surprised by the savage look on her
landscape-gardener's face as he returned the polite salutation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you like Mr. Elliot?&rdquo; she had ventured to
inquire, after the second disagreeable incident of the sort.</p>

<p>Jim Dodge had treated her to one of his dark-browed, incisive
glances before replying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm afraid I can't answer that question satisfactorily,
Miss Orr,&rdquo; was what he said.</p>

<p>And Lydia, wondering, desisted from further question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That middle one looks some like one of the young ladies
that was here this morning,&rdquo; observed Martha, with the
privileged familiarity of an old servant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must have dropped it,&rdquo; said Lydia, slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young ladies here in the country has very bad
manners,&rdquo; commented Martha, puckering her lips primly. &ldquo;I
wouldn't put myself out for them, if I was you, mem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia turned the picture over and gazed abstractedly at the three
words written there: &ldquo;Lest we forget!&rdquo;  Beneath this
pertinent quotation appeared the initials &ldquo;W. E.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it was for <em>me</em> to say,&rdquo; went on Martha, in
an injured tone, &ldquo;I'd not be for feedin' up every man, woman
and child that shows their face inside the grounds. Why, they don't
appreciate it no more than&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman's eloquent gesture appeared to include the blue-bottle
fly buzzing noisily on the window-pane:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious! if these flies ain't enough to drive a
body crazy&mdash;what with the new paint and all....&rdquo;</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XIII</h4>

<p>Lydia laid the picture carefully away in a pigeonhole of her desk.
She was still thinking soberly of the subtle web of prejudices,
feelings and conditions into which she had obtruded her one fixed
purpose in life. But if Mr. Elliot had been as good as engaged to
Fanny Dodge, as Mrs. Solomon Black had been at some pains to imply,
in what way had she (Lydia) interfered with the
d&eacute;nouement?</p>

<p>She shook her head at last over the intricacies of the imperfectly
stated problem. The idea of coquetting with a man had never entered
Lydia's fancy. Long since, in the chill spring of her girlhood, she
had understood her position in life as compared with that of other
girls. She must never marry. She must never fall in love, even. The
inflexible Puritan code of her uncle's wife had found ready
acceptance in Lydia's nature. If not an active participant in her
father's crime, she still felt herself in a measure responsible for
it. He had determined to grow rich and powerful for her sake. More
than once, in the empty rambling talk which he poured forth in a
turgid stream during their infrequent meetings, he had told her so,
with extravagant phrase and gesture. And so, at last, she had come to
share his punishment in a hundred secret, unconfessed ways. She ate
scant food, slept on the hardest of beds, labored unceasingly, with
the great, impossible purpose of some day making things right: of
restoring the money they&mdash;she no longer said
<em>he</em>&mdash;had stolen; of building again the waste places
desolated by the fire of his ambition for her. There had followed
that other purpose, growing ever stronger with the years, and
deepening with the deepening stream of her womanhood: her love, her
vast, unavailing pity for the broken and aging man, who would some
day be free. She came at length to the time when she saw clearly that
he would never leave the prison alive, unless in some way she could
contrive to keep open the clogging springs of hope and desire. She
began deliberately and with purpose to call back memories of the
past: the house in which he had lived, the gardens and orchards in
which he once had taken pride, his ambitious projects for village
improvement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have it all back, father!&rdquo; she promised
him, with passionate resolve. &ldquo;And it will only be a little
while to wait, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, the prisoner's horizon widened, day by day. He
appeared, indeed, to almost forget the prison, so busy was he in
recalling trivial details and unimportant memories of events long
since past. He babbled incessantly of his old neighbors, calling them
by name, and chuckling feebly as he told her of their foibles and
peculiarities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we must give them every cent of the money,
father,&rdquo; she insisted; &ldquo;we must make everything
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! Oh, yes, we'll fix it up somehow with the
creditors,&rdquo; he would say.</p>

<p>Then he would scowl and rub his shorn head with his tremulous old
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did they do with the house, Margaret?&rdquo; he asked,
over and over, a furtive gleam of anxiety in his eyes. &ldquo;They
didn't tear it down; did they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waxed increasingly anxious on this point as the years of his
imprisonment dwindled at last to months. And then her dream had
unexpectedly come true. She had money&mdash;plenty of it&mdash;and
nothing stood in the way. She could never forget the day she told him
about the house. Always she had tried to quiet him with vague
promises and imagined descriptions of a place she had completely
forgotten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The house is ours, father,&rdquo; she assured him,
jubilantly. &ldquo;And I am having it painted on the
outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are having it painted on the outside, Margaret? Was
that necessary, already?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, father.... But I am Lydia. Don't you remember? I am
your little girl, grown up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, of course. You are like your mother&mdash; And
you are having the house painted? Who's doing the job?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She told him the man's name and he laughed rather
immoderately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He'll do you on the white lead, if you don't watch
him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know Asa Todd. Talk about frauds&mdash;
You must be sure he puts honest linseed oil in the paint. He won't,
unless you watch him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll see to it, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But whatever you do, don't let 'em into my room,&rdquo; he
went on, after a frowning pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean your library, father? I'm having the ceiling
whitened. It&mdash;it needed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean my bedroom, child. I won't have workmen pottering
about in there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you won't mind if they paint the woodwork, father?
It&mdash;has grown quite yellow in places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, my dear! Why, I had all the paint upstairs gone
over&mdash;let me see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he fell into one of his heavy moods of introspection which
seemed, indeed, not far removed from torpor.</p>

<p>When she had at last roused him with an animated description of
the vegetable garden, he appeared to have forgotten his objections to
having workmen enter his chamber. And Lydia was careful not to recall
it to his mind.</p>

<p>She was still sitting before his desk, ostensibly absorbed in the
rows of incomprehensible figures Deacon Whittle, as general
contractor, had urged upon her attention, when Martha again parted
the heavy cloud of her thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The minister, come to see you again,&rdquo; she announced,
with a slight but mordant emphasis on the ultimate word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lydia, rousing herself, with an effort.
&ldquo;Mr. Elliot, you said?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I s'pose that's his name,&rdquo; conceded Martha
ungraciously. &ldquo;I set him in the dining room. It's about the
only place with two chairs in it; an' I shan't have no time to make
more lemonade, in case you wanted it, m'm.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XIV</h4>

<p>The Reverend Wesley Elliot, looking young, eager and pleasingly
worldly in a blue serge suit of unclerical cut, rose to greet her as
she entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven't been here in two or three days,&rdquo; he began,
as he took the hand she offered, &ldquo;and I'm really astonished at
the progress you've been making.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He still retained her hand, as he smiled down into her grave,
preoccupied face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's the trouble with our little lady of Bolton
House?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Any of the workmen on strike,
or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She withdrew her hand with a faint smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything is going very well, I think,&rdquo; she told
him.</p>

<p>He was still scrutinizing her with that air of intimate concern,
which inspired most of the women of his flock to unburden themselves
of their manifold anxieties at his slightest word of
encouragement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a pretty heavy burden for you,&rdquo; he said gravely.
&ldquo;You need some one to help you. I wonder if I couldn't shoulder
a few of the grosser details?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You've already been most kind,&rdquo; Lydia said evasively.
&ldquo;But now&mdash; Oh, I think everything has been thought of. You
know Mr. Whittle is looking after the work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled, a glimmer of humorous understanding in his fine dark
eyes. &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>A silence fell between them. Lydia was one of those rare women who
do not object to silence. It seemed to her that she had always lived
alone with her ambitions, which could not be shared, and her bitter
knowledge, which was never to be spoken of. But now she stirred
uneasily in her chair, aware of the intent expression in his eyes.
Her troubled thoughts reverted to the little picture which had
fluttered to the floor from somebody's keeping only an hour
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've had visitors this morning,&rdquo; she told him, with
purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! people are sure to be curious and interested,&rdquo; he
commented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were Mrs. Dodge and her daughter and Mrs. Dix and
Ellen,&rdquo; she explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That must have been pleasant,&rdquo; he murmured
perfunctorily. &ldquo;Are you&mdash;do you find yourself becoming at
all interested in the people about here? Of course it is easy to see
you come to us from quite another world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;&mdash;If you mean
that I am superior in any way to the people of Brookville; I'm not,
at all. I am really a very ordinary sort of a person. I've not been
to college and&mdash;I've always worked, harder than most, so that
I've had little opportunity for&mdash;culture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His smile broadened into a laugh of genuine amusement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Orr,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;I had no idea
of intimating&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her look of passionate sincerity halted his words of apology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very much interested in the people here,&rdquo; she
declared. &ldquo;I want&mdash;oh, so much&mdash;to be friends with
them! I want it more than anything else in the world! If they would
only like me. But&mdash;they don't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can they help it?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Like you?
They ought to worship you! They shall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one can compel love,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes the love of one can atone for the
indifference&mdash;even the hostility of the many,&rdquo; he
ventured.</p>

<p>But she had not stooped to the particular, he perceived. Her
thoughts were ranging wide over an unknown country whither, for the
moment, he could not follow. He studied her abstracted face with its
strangely aloof expression, like that of a saint or a fanatic, with a
faint renewal of previous misgivings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very much interested in Fanny Dodge,&rdquo; she said
abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In&mdash;Fanny Dodge?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>He became instantly angry with himself for the dismayed
astonishment he had permitted to escape him, and increasingly so
because of the uncontrollable tide of crimson which invaded his
face.</p>

<p>She was looking at him, with the calm, direct gaze which had more
than once puzzled him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know her very well, don't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, Miss Dodge is&mdash;she
is&mdash;er&mdash;one of our leading young people, and
naturally&mdash; She plays our little organ in church and Sunday
School. Of course you've noticed. She is most useful
and&mdash;er&mdash;helpful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia appeared to be considering his words with undue gravity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I didn't come here this morning to talk to you about
another woman,&rdquo; he said, with undeniable hardihood. &ldquo;I
want to talk to you&mdash;<em>to you</em>&mdash;and what I have to
say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia got up from her chair rather suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please excuse me a moment,&rdquo; she said, quite as if he
had not spoken.</p>

<p>He heard her cross the hall swiftly. In a moment she had
returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found this picture on the floor&mdash;after they had
gone,&rdquo; she said, and handed him the photograph.</p>

<p>He stared at it with unfeigned astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Well&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn it over,&rdquo; she urged, somewhat breathlessly.</p>

<p>He obeyed, and bit his lip angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;A quotation from
Kipling's Recessional&mdash;a mere commonplace.... Yes; I wrote
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then his anger suddenly left him. His mind had leaped to the
solution of the matter, and the solution appeared to Wesley Elliot as
eminently satisfying; it was even amusing. What a transparent,
womanly little creature she was, to be sure! He had not been
altogether certain of himself as he walked out to the old Bolton
place that morning. But oddly enough, this girlish jealousy of hers,
this pretty spite&mdash;he found it piquantly charming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wrote it,&rdquo; he repeated, his indulgent understanding
of her mood lurking in smiling lips and eyes, &ldquo;on the occasion
of a particularly grubby Sunday School picnic: I assure you I shall
not soon forget the spiders which came to an untimely end in my
lemonade, nor the inquisitive ants which explored my
sandwiches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She surveyed him unsmilingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did not mean that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You were
thinking of something&mdash;quite different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He frowned thoughtfully. Decidedly, this matter should be settled
between them at once and for ever. A clergyman, he reflected, must
always be on friendly&mdash;even confidential terms with a wide
variety of women. His brief experience had already taught him this
much. And a jealous or unduly suspicious wife might prove a serious
handicap to future success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won't you sit down,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;I&mdash;You
must allow me to explain. We&mdash;er&mdash;must talk this
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She obeyed him mechanically. All at once she was excessively
frightened at what she had attempted. She knew nothing of the ways of
men; but she felt suddenly sure that he would resent her interference
as an unwarrantable impertinence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought&mdash;if you were going there today&mdash;you
might take it&mdash;to her,&rdquo; she hesitated. &ldquo;Or, I could
send it. It is a small matter, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;that it is a very
serious matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She interpreted uncertainly the intent gaze of his beautiful,
somber eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came here,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;to&mdash;to find a
home. I had no wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said, his voice deep and
sympathetic; &ldquo;people have been talking to you&mdash;about me.
Am I right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was silent, a pink flush slowly staining her cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not yet learned upon what slight premises country
women, of the type we find in Brookville, arrive at the most
unwarrantable conclusions,&rdquo; he went on carefully. &ldquo;I did
not myself sufficiently realize this, at first. I may have been
unwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you were not!&rdquo; she contradicted him
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>His lifted eyebrows expressed surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would explain to me&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>Then stopped short. How indeed could she explain, when as yet he
had not made clear to her his own purpose, which had grown steadily
with the passing weeks?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will let me speak, first,&rdquo; he concluded
inadequately.</p>

<p>He hastily reviewed the various phrases which arose to his lips
and rejected them one by one. There was some peculiar quality of
coldness, of reserve&mdash;he could not altogether make it clear to
himself: it might well be the knowledge of her power, her wealth,
which lent that almost austere expression to her face. It was evident
that her wonted composure had been seriously disturbed by the unlucky
circumstance of the photograph. He had permitted the time and
occasion which had prompted him to write those three fatefully
familiar words on the back of the picture altogether to escape him.
If he chose to forget, why should Fanny Dodge, or any one else,
persist in remembering?</p>

<p>And above all, why should the girl have chosen to drop this absurd
memento of the most harmless of flirtations at the feet of Lydia?
There could be but one reasonable explanation.... Confound women,
anyway!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had not meant to speak, yet,&rdquo; he went on, out of
the clamoring multitude of his thoughts. &ldquo;I felt that we
ought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He became suddenly aware of Lydia's eyes. There was no soft
answering fire, no maidenly uncertainty of hope and fear in those
clear depths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very difficult for me to talk of this to you,&rdquo;
she said slowly. &ldquo;You will think me over-bold&mdash;unmannerly,
perhaps. But I can't help that. I should never have thought of your
caring for me&mdash;you will at least do me the justice to believe
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lydia!&rdquo; he interrupted, poignantly distressed by her
evident timidity&mdash;her exquisite hesitation, &ldquo;let me speak!
I understand&mdash;I know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She forbade him with a gesture, at once pleading and
peremptory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No! I began this, I must go on
to the end. What you ought to understand is this: I am not like other
women. I want only friendship from every one. I shall never ask more.
I can never accept more&mdash;from any one. I want you to know
this&mdash;now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&mdash;do you realize&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want your friendship,&rdquo; she went on, facing him with
a sort of desperate courage; &ldquo;but more than any kindness you
can offer me, Mr. Elliot, I want the friendship of Fanny Dodge, of
Ellen Dix&mdash;of all good women. I need it! Now you know why I
showed you the picture. If you will not give it to her, I shall. I
want her&mdash;I want every one&mdash;to understand that I shall
never come between her and the slightest hope she may have cherished
before my coming to Brookville. All I ask is&mdash;leave to live here
quietly&mdash;and be friendly, as opportunity offers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her words, her tone were not to be mistaken. But even the sanest
and wisest of men has never thus easily surrendered the jealously
guarded stronghold of sex. Wesley Elliot's youthful ideas of women
were totally at variance with the disconcerting conviction which
strove to invade his mind. He had experienced not the slightest
difficulty, up to the present moment, in classifying them, neatly and
logically; but there was no space in his mental files for a woman
such as Lydia Orr was representing herself to be. It was
inconceivable, on the face of it! All women demanded admiration,
courtship, love. They always had; they always would. The literature
of the ages attested it. He had been too precipitate&mdash;too hasty.
He must give her time to recover from the shock she must have
experienced from hearing the spiteful gossip about himself and Fanny
Dodge. On the whole, he admired her courage. What she had said could
not be attributed to the mere promptings of vulgar sex-jealousy. Very
likely Fanny had been disagreeable and haughty in her manner. He
believed her capable of it. He sympathized with Fanny; with the
curious mental aptitude of a sensitive nature, he still loved Fanny.
It had cost him real effort to close the doors of his heart against
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I admire you more than I can express for what you have had
the courage to tell me,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;And you will
let me see that I understand&mdash;more than you think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible that you should understand,&rdquo; she
said tranquilly. &ldquo;But you will, at least, remember what I have
said?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he promised easily. &ldquo;I shall never
forget it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A slight humorous smile curved the corners of his handsome
mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now this&mdash;er&mdash;what shall we call
it?&mdash;&lsquo;bone of contention&rsquo; savors too strongly of
wrath and discomfiture; so we'll say, simply and specifically, this
photograph&mdash;which chances to have a harmless quotation inscribed
upon its reverse: Suppose I drop it in the waste-basket? I can
conceive that it possesses no particular significance or value for
any one. I assure you most earnestly that it does not&mdash;for
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made as though he would have carelessly torn the picture
across, preparatory to making good his proposal.</p>

<p>She stopped him with a swift gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is lost property,
and I am responsible for its safe-keeping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She perceived that she had completely failed in her intention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with it?&rdquo; he inquired, with
an easy assumption of friendliness calculated to put her more
completely at her ease with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know. For the present, I shall put it back in my
desk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better take my advice and destroy it,&rdquo; he persisted.
&ldquo;It&mdash;er&mdash;is not valuable evidence. Or&mdash;I believe
on second thought I shall accept your suggestion and return it myself
to its probable owner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was actually laughing, his eyes brimming with boyish
mischief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it belongs to Miss Dix,&rdquo; he told her
audaciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Miss Dix?&rdquo; she echoed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; why not? Don't you see the fair Ellen among the
group?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes blazed suddenly upon him; her lips trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; he cried, aghast at his own folly.</p>

<p>She retreated before his outstretched hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't mean to&mdash;to make light of what appears so
serious a matter to you,&rdquo; he went on impetuously. &ldquo;It is
only that it is <em>not</em> serious; don't you see? It is such a
foolish little mistake. It must not come between us,
Lydia!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please go away, at once,&rdquo; she interrupted him
breathlessly, &ldquo;and&mdash;and <em>think</em> of what I have said
to you. Perhaps you didn't believe it; but you <em>must</em> believe
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, because he did not stir, but instead stood gazing at her,
his puzzled eyes full of questions, entreaties, denials, she quietly
closed a door between them. A moment later he heard her hurrying feet
upon the stair.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XV</h4>

<p>August was a month of drought and intense heat that year; by the
first week in September the stream had dwindled to the merest silver
thread, its wasted waters floating upward in clouds of impalpable
mist at dawn and evening to be lost forever in the empty vault of
heaven. Behind the closed shutters of the village houses, women
fanned themselves in the intervals of labor over superheated
cookstoves. Men consulted their thermometers with incredulous eyes.
Springs reputed to be unfailing gradually ceased their cool trickle.
Wells and cisterns yielded little save the hollow sound of the
questing bucket. There was serious talk of a water famine in
Brookville. At the old Bolton house, however, there was still water
in abundance. In jubilant defiance of blazing heavens and parching
earth the Red-Fox Spring&mdash;tapped years before by Andrew Bolton
and piped a mile or more down the mountain side, that his household,
garden and stock might never lack of pure cold water&mdash;gushed in
undiminished volume, filling and overflowing the new cement
reservoir, which had been one of Lydia Orr's cautious innovations in
the old order of things.</p>

<p>The repairs on the house were by now finished, and the new-old
mansion, shining white amid the chastened luxuriance of ancient
trees, once more showed glimpses of snowy curtains behind polished
windowpanes. Flowers, in a lavish prodigality of bloom the Bolton
house of the past had never known, flanked the old stone walls,
bordered the drives, climbed high on trellises and arbors, and blazed
in serried ranks beyond the broad sweep of velvet turf, which repaid
in emerald freshness its daily share of the friendly water.</p>

<p>Mrs. Abby Daggett gazed at the scene in rapt admiration through
the clouds of dust which uprose from under Dolly's scuffling
feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain't that place han'some, now she's fixed it up?&rdquo;
she demanded of Mrs. Deacon Whittle, who sat bolt upright at her
side, her best summer hat, sparsely decorated with purple flowers,
protected from the suffocating clouds of dust by a voluminous brown
veil. &ldquo;I declare I'd like to stop in and see the house, now
it's all furnished up&mdash;if only for a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ain't got time, Abby,&rdquo; Mrs. Whittle pointed out.
&ldquo;There's work to cut out after we get to Mis' Dix's, and it was
kind of late when we started.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett relinquished her random desire with her accustomed
amiability. Life consisted mainly in giving up things, she had found;
but being cheerful, withal, served to cast a mellow glow over the
severest denials; in fact, it often turned them into something
unexpectedly rare and beautiful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess that's so, Ann,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;Dolly got
kind of fractious over his headstall when I was harnessin'. He don't
seem to like his sun hat, and I dunno's I blame him. I guess if our
ears stuck up through the top of our bunnits like his we wouldn't
like it neither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Whittle surveyed the animal's grotesquely bonneted head with
cold disfavor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What simple ideas you do get into your mind, Abby,&rdquo;
said she, with the air of one conscious of superior intellect.
&ldquo;A horse ain't human, Abby. He ain't no idea he's wearing a
hat.... The Deacon says their heads get hotter with them rediculous
bunnits on. He favors a green branch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Daggett, foiling a suspicious
movement of Dolly's switching tail, &ldquo;mebbe that's so; I feel
some cooler without a hat. But 'tain't safe to let the sun beat right
down, the way it does, without something between. Then, you see,
Henry's got a lot o' these horse hats in the store to sell. So of
course Dolly, he has to wear one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Whittle cautiously wiped the dust from her hard red
cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! if it ain't hot,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;You're so
fleshy, Abby, I should think you'd feel it something
terrible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; said Mrs. Daggett placidly.
&ldquo;Of course I'm fleshy, Ann; I ain't denying that; but so be
you. You don't want to think about the heat so constant, Ann. Our
thermometer fell down and got broke day before yesterday, and Henry
says &lsquo;I'll bring you up another from the store this
noon.&rsquo;  But he forgot all about it. I didn't say a word, and
that afternoon I set out on the porch under the vines and felt real
cool&mdash;not knowing it was so hot&mdash;when along comes Mrs.
Fulsom, a-pantin' and fannin' herself. &lsquo;Good land, Abby!&rsquo;
says she; &lsquo;by the looks, a body'd think you didn't know the
thermometer had risen to ninety-two since eleven o'clock this
morning.&rsquo;  &lsquo;I didn't,&rsquo; I says placid; &lsquo;our
thermometer's broke.&rsquo;  &lsquo;Well, you'd better get another
right off,&rsquo; says she, wiping her face and groaning. &lsquo;It's
an awful thing, weather like this, not to have a thermometer right
where you can see it.&rsquo;  Henry brought a real nice one home from
the store that very night; and I hung it out of sight behind the
sitting room door; I told Henry I thought 'twould be safer
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds exactly like you, Abby,&rdquo; commented Mrs.
Whittle censoriously. &ldquo;I should think Henry Daggett would be
onto you, by now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he ain't,&rdquo; said Mrs. Daggett, with mild
triumph. &ldquo;He thinks I'm real cute, an' like that. It does beat
all, don't it? how simple menfolks are. I like 'em all the better for
it, myself. If Henry'd been as smart an' penetrating as some folks, I
don't know as we'd have made out so well together. Ain't it lucky for
me he ain't?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ann Whittle sniffed suspiciously. She never felt quite sure of
Abby Daggett: there was a lurking sparkle in her demure blue eyes and
a suspicious dimple near the corner of her mouth which ruffled Mrs.
Whittle's temper, already strained to the breaking point by the heat
and dust of their midday journey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never should have thought of such a thing, as going
to Ladies' Aid in all this heat, if you hadn't come after me,
Abby,&rdquo; she said crossly. &ldquo;I guess flannel petticoats for
the heathen could have waited a spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe they could, Ann,&rdquo; Mrs. Daggett said soothingly.
&ldquo;It's kind of hard to imagine a heathen wanting any sort of a
petticoat this weather, and I guess they don't wear 'em before
they're converted; but of course the missionaries try to teach 'em
better. They go forth, so to say, with the Bible in one hand and a
petticoat in the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hope so!&rdquo; said Mrs. Whittle, with vague
fervor.</p>

<p>The sight of a toiling wagon supporting a huge barrel caused her
to change the subject rather abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's Jacob Merrill's team,&rdquo; she said, craning her
neck. &ldquo;What on earth has he got in that hogs-head?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's headed for Lydia Orr's spring, I shouldn't
wonder,&rdquo; surmised Mrs. Daggett. &ldquo;She told Henry to put up
a notice in the post office that folks could get all the water they
wanted from her spring. It's running, same as usual; but, most
everybody else's has dried up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the minister ought to pray for rain regular from
the pulpit on Sunday,&rdquo; Mrs. Whittle advanced. &ldquo;I'm going
to tell him so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's going to do a lot better than that,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Daggett.... &ldquo;For the land sake, Dolly! I ain't urged you beyond
your strength, and you know it; but if you don't
g'long&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A vigorous slap of the reins conveyed Mrs. Daggett's unuttered
threat to the reluctant animal, with the result that both ladies were
suddenly jerked backward by an unlooked for burst of speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that horse is dangerous, Abby,&rdquo; remonstrated
Mrs. Whittle, indignantly, as she settled her veil. &ldquo;You ought
to be more careful how you speak up to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll risk him!&rdquo; said Mrs. Daggett with spirit.
&ldquo;It don't help him none to stop walking altogether and stand
stock still in the middle of the road, like he was a graven image.
I'll take the whip to him, if he don't look out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Whittle gathered her skirts about her, with an apprehensive
glance at the dusty road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you das' to touch that whip, Abby Daggett,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;I'll git right out o' this buggy and walk, so
there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett's broad bosom shook with merriment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fer pity sake, Ann, don't be scared,&rdquo; she exhorted
her friend. &ldquo;I ain't never touched Dolly with the whip; but he
knows I mean what I say when I speak to him like that! ...I started
in to tell you about the Red-Fox Spring, didn't I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Whittle coughed dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had a drink of it right now,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;The idea of that Orr girl watering her flowers and grass, when
everybody else in town is pretty near burnt up. Why, we ain't had
water enough in our cistern to do the regular wash fer two weeks. I
said to Joe and the Deacon today: &lsquo;You can wear them shirts
another day, for I don't know where on earth you'll get clean
ones.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ain't nothing selfish about Lydia Orr,&rdquo;
proclaimed Mrs. Daggett joyfully. &ldquo;What <em>do</em> you think
she's going to do now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Whittle's tone implied a jaded indifference to the doings of
any one outside of her own immediate family circle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's going to have the Red-Fox piped down to the
village,&rdquo; said Mrs. Daggett. &ldquo;She's had a man from Boston
to look at it; and he says there's water enough up there in the
mountains to supply two or three towns the size of Brookville. She's
going to have a reservoir: and anybody that's a mind to can pipe it
right into their kitchens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Whittle turned her veiled head to stare incredulously at her
companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;that girl
certainly does like to make a show of her money; don't she? If
'tain't one thing it's another. How did a girl like her come by all
that money, I'd like to know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see as that's any of our particular affairs,&rdquo;
objected Mrs. Daggett warmly. &ldquo;Think of havin' nice cool spring
water, just by turning a faucet. We're going to have it in our house.
And Henry says mebbe he'll put in a tap and a drain-pipe upstairs.
It'd save a lot o' steps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! like enough you'll be talkin' about a regular
nickel-plated bathroom like hers, next,&rdquo; suspicioned Mrs.
Whittle. &ldquo;The Deacon says he did his best to talk her out of
it; but she stuck right to it. And one wa'n't enough, at that. She's
got three of 'em in that house. That's worse'n Andrew
Bolton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean <em>worse</em>, Ann Whittle, or do you mean
<em>better?</em>  A nice white bathtub is a means o' grace, I
think!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean what I said, Abby; and you hadn't ought to talk like
that. It's downright sinful. <em>Means o' grace! a bathtub!</em>
Well, I never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ladies of the Aid Society were already convened in Mrs. Dix's
front parlor, a large square room, filled with the cool green light
from a yard full of trees, whose deep-thrust roots defied the
drought. Ellen Dix had just brought in a glass pitcher, its frosted
sides proclaiming its cool contents, when the late comers
arrived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mrs. Dix was saying, &ldquo;Miss Orr sent over
a big piece of ice this morning and she squeezed out juice of I don't
know how many lemons. Jim Dodge brought 'em here in the auto; and she
told him to go around and gather up all the ladies that didn't have
conveyances of their own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that's how I came to be here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mixter.
&ldquo;Our horse has gone lame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well now, wa'n't that lovely?&rdquo; crowed Mrs. Daggett,
cooling her flushed face with slow sweeps of the big turkey-feather
fan Mrs. Dix handed her. &ldquo;Ain't she just the sweetest
girl&mdash;always thinking of other folks! I never see anything like
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A subtle expression of reserve crept over the faces of the
attentive women. Mrs. Mixter tasted the contents of her glass
critically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; she said dryly, as if the lemonade had
failed to cool her parched throat, &ldquo;that depends on how you
look at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Whittle gave vent to a cackle of rather discordant
laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's just what I was telling Abby on the way over,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Once in a while you do run across a person that's
bound to make a show of their money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Solomon Black, in a green and white sprigged muslin dress,
her water-waves unusually crisp and conspicuous, bit off a length of
thread with a meditative air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that girl lived in my house,
off an' on, for more than two months. I can't say as I think she's
the kind that wants to show off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fifteen needles paused in their busy activities, and twice as many
eyes were focused upon Mrs. Solomon Black. That lady sustained the
combined attack with studied calm. She even smiled, as she jerked her
thread smartly through a breadth of red flannel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I s'pose you knew a lot more about her in the beginning
than we did,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dodge, in a slightly offended tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have known something about her, Phoebe,&rdquo; put
in Mrs. Fulsom. &ldquo;I don't care what anybody says to the
contrary, there's something queer in a young girl, like her, coming
to a strange place, like Brookville, and doing all the things she's
done. It ain't natural: and that's what I told the Judge when he was
considering the new waterworks. There's a great deal of money to be
made on waterworks, the Judge says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eyes were now focused upon Mrs. Fulsom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can tell you, she ain't looking to make money out
of Brookville,&rdquo; said Abby Daggett, laying down her fan and
taking an unfinished red flannel petticoat from the basket on the
table. &ldquo;Henry knows all about her plans, and he says it's the
grandest idea! The water's going to be piped down from the mountain
right to our doors&mdash;an' it'll be just as free as the Water of
Life to anybody that'll take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but who's going to pay for digging up the streets and
putting 'em back?&rdquo; piped up an anxious voice from a corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We'd ought to, if she does the rest,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Daggett; &ldquo;but Henry says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can be mighty sure there's a come-back in it
somewhere,&rdquo; was Mrs. Whittle's opinion. &ldquo;The Deacon says
he don't know whether to vote for it or not. We'll have rain before
long; and these droughts don't come every summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen Dix and Fanny Dodge were sitting outside on the porch. Both
girls were sewing heart-shaped pieces of white cloth upon squares of
turkey-red calico.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn't it funny nobody seems to like her?&rdquo; murmured
Ellen, tossing her head. &ldquo;I shouldn't be surprised if they
wouldn't let her bring the water in, for all she says she'll pay for
everything except putting it in the houses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny gazed at the white heart in the middle of the red
square.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's awfully hard to sew these hearts on without
puckering,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fan,&rdquo; said Ellen cautiously, &ldquo;does the minister
go there much now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny compressed her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm sure I don't know,&rdquo; she replied, her eyes and
fingers busy with an unruly heart, which declined to adjust itself to
requirements. &ldquo;What are they going to do with this silly
patchwork, anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make an autograph quilt for the minister's birthday; didn't
you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny dropped her unfinished work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard of anything so silly!&rdquo; she said
sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody is to write their names in pencil on these
hearts,&rdquo; pursued Ellen mischievously; &ldquo;then they're to be
done in tracing stitch in red cotton. In the middle of the quilt is
to be a big white square, with a large red heart in it; that's
supposed to be Wesley Elliot's. It's to have his monogram in stuffed
letters, in the middle of it. Lois Daggett's doing that now. I think
it's a lovely idea&mdash;so romantic, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny did not appear to be listening; her pretty white forehead
wore a frowning look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo; she said abruptly, &ldquo;do you ever see
anything of Jim nowadays?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! so you thought you'd pay me back, did you?&rdquo; cried
Ellen angrily. &ldquo;I never said I cared a rap for Jim Dodge; but
you told me a whole lot about Wesley Elliot: don't you remember that
night we walked home from the fair, and you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny suddenly put her hand over her friend's.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don't talk so loud, Ellen; somebody will be sure to
hear. I'd forgotten what you said&mdash;truly, I had. But
Jim&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; interrogated Ellen impatiently, arching her
slender black brows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let's walk down in the orchard,&rdquo; proposed Fanny.
&ldquo;Somebody else can work on these silly old hearts, if they want
to. My needle sticks so I can't sew, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've got to help mother cut the cake, in a minute,&rdquo;
objected Ellen.</p>

<p>But she stepped down on the parched grass and the two friends were
soon strolling among the fallen fruit of a big sweet apple tree
behind the house, their arms twined about each other's waists, their
pretty heads bent close together.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XVI</h4>

<p>&ldquo;The reason I spoke to you about Jim just now,&rdquo; said
Fanny, &ldquo;was because he's been acting awfully queer lately. I
thought perhaps you knew&mdash;I know he likes you better than any of
the other girls. He says you have some sense, and the others
haven't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess that must have been before Lydia Orr came to
Brookville,&rdquo; said Ellen, in a hard, sweet voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; it was,&rdquo; admitted Fanny reluctantly.
&ldquo;Everything seems to be different since then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has Jim been doing that's any queerer than
usual?&rdquo; inquired Ellen, with some asperity.</p>

<p>Fanny hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won't tell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not, if it's a secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cross your heart an' hope t' die?&rdquo; quoted Fanny from
their childhood days.</p>

<p>Ellen giggled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cross m' heart an' hope t' die,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jim's been off on some sort of a trip,&rdquo; said
Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't see anything so very queer about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till I tell you&mdash; You must be sure and not
breathe a word, even to your mother; you won't, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fan, you make me mad! Didn't I just say I
wouldn't?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then; he went with <em>her</em> in the auto; they
started about five o'clock in the morning, and Jim didn't get home
till after twelve that night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen laughed, with studied indifference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pity they couldn't have asked us to go along,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I'm sure the car's plenty big enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think it was just for fun,&rdquo; said Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't? What for, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked Jim, and he wouldn't tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you ask him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The morning they went. I came down about half past four:
mother doesn't get up as early as that, we haven't much milk to look
after now; but I wake up awfully early sometimes, and I'd rather be
doing something than lying there wide awake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen squeezed Fanny's arm sympathetically. She herself had lost
no moments of healthy sleep over Jim Dodge's fancied defection; but
she enjoyed imagining herself to be involved in a passionate
romance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn't it <em>awful</em> to lie awake and
think&mdash;<em>and think</em>, and not be able to do a single
thing!&rdquo; she said, with a tragic gesture.</p>

<p>Fanny bent down to look into Ellen's pretty face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Ellen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is it as bad as that? I
didn't suppose you really cared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She clasped Ellen's slender waist closer and kissed her
fervently.</p>

<p>Ellen coaxed two shining tears into sparkling prominence on her
long lashes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don't mind me, Fan,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;but I
<em>can</em> sympathize with you, dear. I know <em>exactly</em> how
you feel&mdash;and to think it's the same girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen giggled light-heartedly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, she can't marry both of them,&rdquo; she
finished.</p>

<p>Fanny was looking away through the boles of the gnarled old trees,
her face grave and preoccupied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I oughtn't to have told you,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you haven't told me anything, yet,&rdquo; protested
Ellen. &ldquo;You're the funniest girl, Fan! I don't believe you know
how to&mdash;really confide in anybody. If you'd tell me more how you
feel about <em>him</em>, you wouldn't care half so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny winced perceptibly. She could not bear to speak of the
secret&mdash;which indeed appeared to be no secret&mdash;she strove
daily to bury under a mountain of hard work, but which seemed
possessed of mysterious powers of resurrection in the dark hours
between sunset and sunrise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there's nothing to&mdash;to talk about, Ellen,&rdquo;
she said; and in spite of herself her voice sounded cold, almost
menacing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well, if you feel that way,&rdquo; retorted Ellen.
&ldquo;But I can tell you one thing&mdash;or, I <em>might</em> tell
you something; but I guess I won't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Ellen,&mdash;if it's about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny's eyes pleaded hungrily with the naughty Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven't finished your account of that interesting
pleasure excursion of Jim's and Miss Orr's,&rdquo; said Ellen.
&ldquo;Isn't it lovely Jim can drive her car? Is he going to be her
regular chauffeur? And do you get an occasional joy-ride?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Fanny said indignantly. &ldquo;Oh,
Ellen, how can you go on like that! I'm sure you don't care a bit
about Jim or me, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do!&rdquo; declared Ellen. &ldquo;I love you with all my
heart, Fan; but I don't know about Jim. I&mdash;I might
have&mdash;you know; but if he's crazy over that Orr girl, what's the
use? There are other men, just as good-looking as Jim Dodge and not
half so sarcastic and disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim can be disagreeable, if he wants to,&rdquo; conceded
Jim's sister. &ldquo;When I asked him where he was going with the car
so early in the morning&mdash;you know he's been bringing the car
home nights so as to clean it and fix the engine, till she can get
somebody&mdash;I was surprised to find him putting in oil and
tightening up screws and things, when it was scarcely daylight; and I
said so. He wouldn't tell me a thing. &lsquo;You just 'tend to your
own knitting, Fan,&rsquo; was all he said; &lsquo;perhaps you'll know
some day; and then again, perhaps you won't.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And didn't you find out?&rdquo; cried Ellen, her dark eyes
alight with curiosity. &ldquo;If that doesn't sound exactly like Jim
Dodge! But you said you heard him when he came in that night; didn't
he tell you anything then?&mdash;You don't think they ran off to get
married? Oh, Fan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not, you goose! Do you suppose he'd have come
back home alone, if it had been anything like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen heaved a sigh of exaggerated relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Be still, my heart&rsquo;!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; they went to get somebody from somewhere,&rdquo;
pursued Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To get somebody from somewhere,&rdquo; repeated Ellen
impatiently. &ldquo;How thrilling! Who do you suppose it
was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny shook her head:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven't the slightest idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How perfectly funny! ...Is the somebody there,
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know. Jim won't tell me a thing that goes on there.
He says if there's anything on top of the earth he absolutely
despises it's a gossiping man. He says a gossiping woman is a
creation of God&mdash;must be, there's so many of 'em; but a
gossiping man&mdash;he can't find any word in the dictionary mean
enough for that sort of a low-down skunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen burst into hysterical laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an idea!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Oh, but he's almost
too sweet to live, Fan. Somebody ought to take him down a peg or two.
Fan, if he proposes to that girl, I hope she won't have him. 'Twould
serve him right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she won't marry anybody around here,&rdquo; mused
Fanny. &ldquo;Did you ever notice she wears a thin gold chain around
her neck, Ellen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there's a picture of somebody on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn't wonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen impatiently kicked a big apple out of her way, to the
manifest discomfiture of two or three drunken wasps who were
battening on the sweet juices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've got to go back to the house,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Mother'll be looking for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Ellen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said you knew something&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen yawned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know you did, Ellen! Please&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Twasn't much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, only I met the minister coming out of Lydia
Orr's house one day awhile ago, and he was walking along as if he'd
been sent for&mdash; Never even saw me. I had a good mind to speak to
him, anyway; but before I could think of anything cute to say he'd
gone by&mdash;two-forty on a plank road!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny was silent. She was wishing she had not asked Ellen to tell.
Then instantly her mind began to examine this new aspect of her
problem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn't look so awfully pleased and happy,&rdquo; Ellen
went on, &ldquo;his head was down&mdash;so, and he was just scorching
up the road. Perhaps they'd been having a scrap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; burst from Fanny's lips. &ldquo;It wasn't
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you know about Wesley Elliot and Lydia
Orr?&rdquo; inquired Ellen vindictively. &ldquo;You're a whole lot
like Jim&mdash;as close-mouthed as a molasses jug, when you don't
happen to feel like talking.... It isn't fair,&rdquo; she went on
crossly. &ldquo;I tell you everything&mdash;every single thing; and
you just take it all in without winking an eyelash. It isn't
fair!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ellen, please don't&mdash;I can't bear it from
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny's proud head drooped to her friend's shoulder, a stifled sob
escaped her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There now, Fan; I didn't mean a word of it! I'm sorry I
told you about him&mdash;only I thought he looked so kind of cut up
over something that maybe&mdash; Honest, Fan, I don't believe he
likes her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't know,&rdquo; murmured Fanny, wiping her wet eyes.
&ldquo;I didn't tell you she came to see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; it was after we had all been there, and mother was
going on so about the furniture. It all seemed so mean and sordid to
me, as if we were trying to&mdash;well, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen nodded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do. That's why you wouldn't let her have your
furniture. I gloried in your spunk, Fan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I did let her have it, Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did? Well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll tell you how it happened. Mother'd gone down to the
village, and Jim was off somewhere&mdash;he's never in the house
day-times any more; I'd been working on the new curtains all day, and
I was just putting them up in the parlor, when she came.... Ellen,
sometimes I think perhaps we don't understand that girl. She was just
as sweet&mdash; If it wasn't for&mdash; If I hadn't hardened my heart
against her almost the first thing, you know, I don't believe I could
help loving her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny!&rdquo; cried Ellen protestingly. &ldquo;She
certainly is a soft-soap artist. My mother says she is so refined;
and Mrs. Daggett is always chanting her praises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of all she's done for the village,&rdquo; urged
Fanny. &ldquo;I want to be just, even if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't!&rdquo; cried Ellen. &ldquo;I just enjoy
being real spiteful sometimes&mdash;especially when another girl
gobbles all the men in sight; and I know I'm prettier than she is.
It's just because she's new and&mdash;and stylish and rich. What made
you give in about your furniture, Fan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny stopped short, puckering her forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know whether I can explain it, Ellen; but I notice
it every time I am with her. There's something&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Fan! She must have hypnotized
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Ellen, I'm trying to think just how it happened.
She didn't say so very much&mdash;just sat down and watched me, while
I sewed rings on the curtains. But the first thing I knew, I piped up
and said: &lsquo;Do you really want that old furniture of mine so
much?&rsquo;  And she said&mdash; Well, no matter what she said; it
was more the way she looked. I guess I'd have given her the eyes out
of my head, or any old thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's just what I told you,&rdquo; interrupted Ellen.
&ldquo;There are people like that. Don't you remember that horrid old
what's-his-name in &lsquo;Trilby&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't be silly, Ellen,&rdquo; said Fanny rebukingly.
&ldquo;Well, I took her up to my room and showed her my bed and
bureau and washstand. There were some chairs, too; mother got them
all for my room at that old auction we've heard so much about; I was
just a baby then. I told her about it. She sat down in my
rocking-chair by the window and just looked at the things, without
saying a word, at first. After a while, she said: &lsquo;Your mother
used to come in and tuck the blankets around you nice and warm in the
night; didn't she?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, I suppose she did,&rsquo; I told her.
&lsquo;Mother's room is right next to mine.&rsquo; ... Ellen, there
was a look in her eyes&mdash;I can't tell you about it&mdash;you
wouldn't understand. And, anyway, I didn't care a bit about the
furniture. &lsquo;You can have it,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I don't want
it, and I don't see why you do; it isn't pretty any more.&rsquo;  I
thought she was going to cry, for a minute. Then such a soft gladness
came over her face. She came up to me and took both my hands in hers;
but all she said was &lsquo;Thank you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did she pay you a whole lot for it?&rdquo; inquired
Ellen sordidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't think anything about that part of it,&rdquo; said
Fanny. &ldquo;Jim carried it all over the next day, with a lot of old
stuff mother had. Jim says she's had a man from Grenoble working in
the barn for weeks and weeks, putting everything in order. My old set
was painted over, with all the little garlands and blue ribbons, like
new.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how much&mdash;&rdquo; persisted Ellen. &ldquo;She must
have paid you a lot for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't ask mother,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;I didn't
want to know. I've got a new set; it's real pretty. You must come
over and see my room, now it's all finished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What Fanny did not tell Ellen was that after Lydia's departure she
had unexpectedly come upon the photograph of the picnic group under a
book on her table. The faded picture with its penciled words had
meant much to Fanny. She had not forgotten, she told herself, she
could never forget, that day in June, before the unlooked-for arrival
of the strange girl, whose coming had changed everything. Once more
she lived over in imagination that perfect day, with its white clouds
floating high in the blue, and the breath of clover on the wind. She
and Wesley Elliot had gone quietly away into the woods after the
boisterous merriment of the picnic luncheon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's safe enough, as long as we follow the stream,&rdquo;
Fanny had assured him, piloting the way over fallen logs and through
dense thickets of pine and laurel, further and further away from the
sounds of shrill laughter and the smoky smell of the camp fire, where
the girls were still busy toasting marshmallows on long sticks for
the youths who hovered in the rear.</p>

<p>The minister had expressed a keen desire to hear the rare notes of
the hermit thrush; and this romantic quest led them deep into the
forest. The girl paused at last on the brink of a pool, where they
could see the shadowy forms of brook trout gliding through the clear,
cold water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we are quiet and listen,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;I
think we shall hear the hermit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On a carpet of moss, thicker and softer than a deep-piled rug,
they sat down. Not a sound broke the stillness but the gurgle of
water and the soft soughing of the wind through great tree tops. The
minister bared his head, as if aware of the holy spirit of solitude
in the place. Neither spoke nor stirred; but the girl's heart beat
loud&mdash;so loud she feared he might hear, and drew her little cape
closer above her breast. Then all at once, ringing down the somber
aisles of the forest came the song of the solitary bird, exquisite,
lonely, filled with an indescribable, yearning sweetness. The man's
eloquent eyes met her own in a long look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

<p>His hand sought and closed upon hers for an instant. Then without
further speech they returned to the picnickers. Someone&mdash;she
thought it was Joyce Fulsom&mdash;snapped the joyous group at the
moment of the departure. It had been a week later, that he had
written the words &ldquo;Lest we forget&rdquo;&mdash;with a look and
smile which set the girl's pulses fluttering. But that was in June.
Now it was September. Fanny, crouched by the window where Lydia Orr
had been that afternoon, stared coldly at the picture. It was
downright silly to have carried it about with her. She had lost it
somewhere&mdash;pulling out her handkerchief, perhaps. Had Lydia Orr
found and brought it back? She ardently wished she knew; but in the
meanwhile&mdash;</p>

<p>She tore the picture deliberately across, thereby accomplishing
unhindered what Wesley Elliot had attempted several days before; then
she burned the fragments in the quick spurt of a lighted match....
Lest we forget, indeed!</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XVII</h4>

<p>The day after the sewing society Ellen Dix went up to her room,
after hurriedly washing the dinner dishes. It was still hot, but a
vague haze had crept across the brazen sky since morning. Ellen's
room looked out into cool green depths of trees, so that on a cloudy
day it was almost too dark to examine the contents of the closet
opposite its two east windows.</p>

<p>It was a pretty room, freshly papered and painted, as were many
rooms in Brookville since the sale of the old Bolton properties.
Nearly every one had scrimped and saved and gone without so long that
the sudden influx of money into empty pockets had acted like wine in
a hungry stomach. Henry Daggett had thrice replenished his stock of
wall papers; window shades and curtaining by the yard had been in
constant demand for weeks; bright colored chintzes and gay flowered
cretonnes were apparently a prime necessity in many households. As
for paper hangers and painters, few awaited their unhurried
movements. It was easy for anybody with energy and common sense to
wield a paintbrush; and old paper could be scraped off and fresh
strips applied by a simple application of flour paste and the
fundamental laws of physics. One improvement clamors loudly for
another, and money was still coming in from the most unexpected
sources, so new furniture was bought to take the place of unprized
chairs and tables long ago salvaged from the Bolton wreck. And since
Mrs. Deacon Whittle's dream parlor, with its marble-tops and
plush-upholstered furniture, had become a solid reality, other
parlors burgeoned forth in multi-colored magnificence. Scraggy old
shrubs were trimmed; grass was cut in unkempt dooryards; flowers were
planted&mdash;and all because of the lavish display of such
improvements at Bolton House, as &ldquo;that queer Orr girl&rdquo;
persisted in calling it; thereby flying in the face of public opinion
and local prejudice in a way which soured the milk of human kindness
before the cream of gratitude could rise.</p>

<p>Everybody agreed that there was something mysterious, if not
entirely unnatural in the conduct of the young woman. Nobody likes
unsolved riddles for long. The moment or century of suspense may
prove interesting&mdash;even exciting; but human intelligence resents
the Sphynx.</p>

<p>Ellen Dix was intensely human. She was, moreover, jealous&mdash;or
supposed she was, which often amounts to the same thing. And because
of this she was looking over the dresses, hanging on pegs along her
closet wall, with a demurely puckered brow. The pink muslin was
becoming, but old-fashioned; the pale yellow trimmed with black
velvet might get soiled with the dust, and she wasn't sure it would
wash. She finally selected a white dress of a new and becoming style,
attired in which she presently stood before her mirror adjusting a
plain Panama hat, trimmed simply with a black ribbon. Not for nothing
had Ellen used her handsome dark eyes. She set the hat over her black
hair at exactly the right angle, skewering it securely in place with
two silver pins, also severely simple in their style and quite unlike
the glittering rhinestone variety offered for sale in Henry Daggett's
general store.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm going out for a while, mother,&rdquo; she said, as she
passed the room where Mrs. Dix was placidly sewing carpet rags out of
materials prodigiously increased of late, since both women had been
able to afford several new dresses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to Fanny's?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Dix.... &ldquo;Seems
to me you're starting out pretty early, dear, in all this heat. If
you'll wait till sundown, I'll go with you. I haven't seen their
parlor since they got the new curtains up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm not going to Fanny's, right off,&rdquo; said Ellen
evasively. &ldquo;Maybe I'll stop on the way back, though. 'Tisn't
very hot; it's clouded up some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better taken an umbrella,&rdquo; her mother sent after her.
&ldquo;We might get a thunder storm along towards four o'clock. My
shoulder's been paining me all the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ellen had already passed out of hearing, her fresh skirts held
well away from the dusty wayside weeds.</p>

<p>She was going, with intentions undefined, to see Lydia Orr.
Perhaps (she was thinking) she might see Jim Dodge. Anyway, she
wanted to go to Bolton House. She would find out for herself wherein
lay the curious fascination of which Fanny had spoken. She was
surprised at Fanny for so easily giving in about the furniture.
Secretly, she considered herself to be possibly a bit shrewder than
Fanny. In reality she was not as easily influenced, and slower at
forming conclusions. She possessed a mind of more scope.</p>

<p>Ellen walked along, setting her pointed feet down very carefully
so as not to raise the dust and soil her nice skirts. She was a
dainty creature. When she reached the hedge which marked the
beginning of the Bolton estate, she started, not violently, that was
not her way, but anybody is more startled at the sudden glimpse of a
figure at complete rest, almost rigidity, than of a figure in motion.
Had the old man whom Ellen saw been walking along toward her, she
would not have started at all. She might have glanced at him with
passing curiosity, since he was a stranger in Brookville, then that
would have been the end of it. But this old man, standing as firmly
fixed as a statue against the hedge, startled the girl. He was rather
a handsome old man, but there was something peculiar about him. For
one thing he was better dressed than old men in Brookville generally
were. He wore a light Palm Beach cloth suit, possibly too young for
him, also a Panama hat. He did not look altogether tidy. He did not
wear his up-to-date clothes very well. He had a rumpled appearance.
He was very pale almost with the paleness of wax. He did not stand
strongly, but rested his weight first on one foot, then on the other.
Ellen recovered her composure, but as she was passing, he spoke
suddenly. His tone was eager and pitiful. &ldquo;Why Ann Eliza
Dix,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How do you do? You are not going to pass
without speaking to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Dix, but not Ann Eliza,&rdquo; said Ellen
politely; &ldquo;my name is Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are Cephas Dix's sister, Ann Eliza,&rdquo; insisted the
old man. His eyes looked suddenly tearful. &ldquo;I know I am
right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are Ann Eliza Dix.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl felt a sudden pity. Her Aunt Ann Eliza Dix had been lying
in her grave for ten years, but she could not contradict the poor
man. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How do you
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man's face lit up. &ldquo;I knew I was right,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I forget, you see, sometimes, but this time I was sure.
How are you, Ann Eliza?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is Cephas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is well, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen shivered a little. It was rather bewildering. This strange
old man must mean her grandfather, who had died before her Aunt Ann
Eliza. She replied faintly that he was well, and hoped, with a qualm
of ghastly mirth, that she was speaking the truth. Ellen's
grandfather had not been exactly a godly man, and the family seldom
mentioned him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He means well, Ann Eliza, if sometimes you don't exactly
like the way he does,&rdquo; said the living old man, excusing the
dead one for the faults of his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know he does,&rdquo; said Ellen. The desire to laugh grew
upon her.</p>

<p>She was relieved when the stranger changed the subject. She felt
that she would become hysterical if this forcible resurrection of her
dead relatives continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like an automobile?&rdquo; asked the old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know, I never had one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger looked at her confidingly. &ldquo;My daughter has
one,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I know she bought it for me, and she
has me taken out in it, but I am afraid. It goes too fast. I can't
get over being afraid. But you won't tell her, will you, Ann
Eliza?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I won't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen continued to gaze at him, but she did not speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see, what is your name, my dear?&rdquo; the man went
on. He was leaning on his stick, and Ellen noticed that he trembled
slightly, as though with weakness. He breathed hard. The veinous
hands folded on top of the stick were almost as white as his
ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Ellen Dix,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dix&mdash;Dix?&rdquo; repeated the man. &ldquo;Why, I know
that name, certainly, of course! You must be the daughter of Cephas
Dix. Odd name, Cephas, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen nodded, her eyes still busy with the details of the
stranger's appearance. She was sure she had never seen him before,
yet he knew her father's name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father has been dead a long time,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;ever since I was a little girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man appeared singularly disquieted by this intelligence.
&ldquo;I hadn't heard that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Dead&mdash;a long
time? Well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He scowled, flourishing his stick as if to pass on; then settled
to his former posture, his pale hands folded on its handsome gold
top.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cephas Dix wasn't an old man,&rdquo; he muttered, as if
talking to himself. &ldquo;Not old. He should be hale and hearty,
living in this good country air. Wonderful air this, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he drew a deep breath, his wandering gaze returning swiftly to
the girl's face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just walking out,&rdquo; he said, nodding briskly.
&ldquo;Great treat to be able to walk out. I shall walk out whenever
I like. Don't care for automobiles&mdash;get you over the road too
fast. No, no; I won't go out in the automobile, unless I feel like
it! No, I won't; and there's an end of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He brought his stick down heavily in the dust, as if emphasizing
this statement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess your father left you pretty well off, eh, my
dear?&rdquo; he went on presently. &ldquo;Glad to see you looking so
fresh and neat. Always like to see a pretty girl well
dressed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man's eyes, extraordinarily bright and keen, roved nimbly over
her face and figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he did not,&rdquo; replied Ellen. &ldquo;My father used
to be rich,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I've heard mother tell about
it hundreds of times. We had horses and a carriage and plenty of
money; but when the bank went to pieces my father lost everything.
Then he died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man was peering at her from under his shaggy gray brows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not because the bank failed? Surely not because he lost
his money? That sort of thing doesn't kill a man, my dear. No,
no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It did,&rdquo; declared Ellen firmly.</p>

<p>The man at once seemed to grow smaller; to huddle together in his
clothes. He muttered something unintelligible, then turned squarely
about, so that Ellen could see only his hunched back and the
glistening white hair cut close behind his waxen ears.</p>

<p>The girl walked thoughtfully on, but when she paused to look back
she saw that he had resumed his slow walk in the opposite direction,
his stick describing odd flourishes in the air, as before.</p>

<p>When she reached Bolton House she was ushered into a beautiful
parlor by a prim maid in a frilled cap and apron. The maid presented
to her attention a small silver tray, and Ellen, blushing
uncomfortably because she had no card, asked for Miss Orr.</p>

<p>Soon the frilled maid reappeared. &ldquo;I'm sorry, Miss,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;I thought Miss Lydia was at home, but I can't find
her anywheres about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She eyed Ellen's trim figure doubtfully. &ldquo;If there was any
message&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;I only came to
call.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm real sorry, Miss,&rdquo; repeated the maid. &ldquo;Miss
Lydia'll be sorry, too. Who shall I say, please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Dix,&rdquo; replied Ellen. She walked past the maid,
who held the door wide for her exit. Then she paused. A surprising
sight met her eyes. Lydia Orr, hatless, flushed as if by rapid
flight, was just reaching the steps, convoying the strange old man
Ellen had met on the road a short time before.</p>

<p>The maid at her back gave a little cry. Ellen stood staring. So
this was the person Jim Dodge had gone to fetch from somewhere!</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it isn't too warm for me to be walking out to take the
air,&rdquo; she heard, in the heavy mumble of the man's voice.
&ldquo;I don't like being watched, Lydia; and I won't stand it,
either. I might as well be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia interrupted him with a sharp exclamation. She had caught
sight of Ellen Dix standing under the deep portico, the scared face
of the maid looking over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Ellen's face crimsoned slowly. All at once she felt unaccountably
sorry and ashamed. She wished she had not come. She felt that she
wanted nothing so much as to hurry swiftly away.</p>

<p>But Lydia Orr, still holding the strange old man by the arm, was
already coming up the steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll not go in the automobile, child,&rdquo; he repeated,
with an obstinate flourish of his stick. &ldquo;I don't like to ride
so fast. I want to see things. I want&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped short, his mouth gaping, his eyes staring at Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That girl!&rdquo; he almost shouted. &ldquo;She told
me&mdash;I don't want her here.... Go away, girl, you make my head
hurt!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia flashed a beseeching look at Ellen, as she led the old man
past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please come in,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I shall be at
liberty in just a moment.... Come, father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I'd better not, today,&rdquo; she murmured, and
slowly descended the steps.</p>

<p>The discreet maid closed the door behind her.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XVIII</h4>

<p>Ellen did not at once return home. She walked on reflecting. So
the old man was Lydia Orr's father! And she was the first to know
it!</p>

<p>The girl had never spoken of her father, Ellen was sure. Had she
done so, Mrs. Solomon Black would certainly have told Mrs. Whittle,
and Mrs. Whittle would have informed Mrs. Daggett, and thence, by way
of Mrs. Dodge and Fanny, the news would long ago have reached Ellen
and her mother.</p>

<p>Before she had covered a quarter of a mile of the dusty road,
Ellen heard the muffled roar of an over-taking motor car. She glanced
up, startled and half choked with the enveloping cloud of dust. Jim
Dodge was driving the car. He slowed down and stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Ellen. Going down to the village? Get in and I'll
take you along,&rdquo; he called out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Ellen, jumping in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven't seen you for an age, Jim,&rdquo; said Ellen after
awhile.</p>

<p>The young man laughed. &ldquo;Does it seem that long to you,
Ellen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, why should it?&rdquo; she returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Ellen,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;I saw you when you
came out of Bolton House just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  He looked sharply at Ellen, who smiled
evasively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to call,&rdquo; she said with an innocent air,
&ldquo;but Miss Orr had&mdash;a visitor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Ellen; don't let's beat about the bush. Nobody
knows he's there, yet, except myself and&mdash;you. You met him on
the road; didn't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ellen, &ldquo;I met him on the
road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he talk to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He asked me what my name was. He's crazy, isn't he,
Jim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man frowned thoughtfully at his steering wheel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; he said, after a pause. &ldquo;He's
been sick a long time and his mind is&mdash;well, I think it has been
somewhat affected. Did he&mdash; He didn't talk to you about himself,
did he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want to know for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he appeared rather excited, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I noticed that.&rdquo;  She laughed mischievously.</p>

<p>Jim frowned. &ldquo;Come, Ellen, quit this nonsense! What did he
say to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you mean Mr. Orr&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned his eyes from the road to stare at her for an
instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you his name was Orr?&rdquo; he asked
sharply.</p>

<p>It was Ellen's turn to stare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, if he is Miss Orr's father&mdash;&rdquo; she
began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; said Jim hurriedly. &ldquo;I was just
wondering if he had introduced himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen was silent. She was convinced that there was some mystery
about the pale old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said a lot of awfully queer things to me,&rdquo; she
admitted, after a pause during which Jim turned the car into a side
road.... &ldquo;I thought you were going to the village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will take us to the village&mdash;give you a longer
ride, Ellen. I'll take you home afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, after we've got the mail&mdash;or whatever you
want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't you think Miss Orr and that queer old Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; If his name isn't Orr, Jim, what is it?&rdquo;  She
shot a quick glance at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; muttered Jim profanely.</p>

<p>He drew the car up at the side of the road and stopped it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; inquired Ellen, in some
alarm. &ldquo;Won't it go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I get ready,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>

<p>He turned and faced her squarely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We'll have this out, before we go a foot further! I won't
have the whole town talking,&rdquo; he said savagely.</p>

<p>Ellen said nothing. She was rather angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; cried Jim Dodge. &ldquo;What's the matter
with you, Ellen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With me?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Why can't you talk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;I want to go home,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>He seized her roughly by the wrist. &ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I believe you know more than you are willing to tell.&rdquo;
He stared down into her eyes. &ldquo;What did he say to you,
anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know well enough. The old man. Lord, what a
mess!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please let me go, Jim,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;Now look
here, I know absolutely nothing except what I have told you, and I
want to go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Ellen!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you keep a secret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I can, Jim!&rdquo;  She met his dark gaze
squarely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, rather than have you spreading a piece of damnable
gossip over the village&mdash; Of course you would have told
everybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean about meeting the old man? But won't everybody
know? If he goes out and talks to people as he did to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven't told me what he said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen raised her brows with a mischievous air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't care to spread any&mdash;what sort of gossip did
you say, Jim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound it! I didn't mean that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I could see he was some one who used to live
here,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;He knew father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim had thrust his hands deep into his trousers' pockets. He
uttered an impatient ejaculation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he said he should go out whenever he felt like it. He
doesn't like the automobile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it's an impossible proposition. I see that plainly
enough!&rdquo; Jim said, as if to himself. &ldquo;But it seems a
pity&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He appeared to plunge into profound meditation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Ellen, you like her; don't you? ...Don't see how you
can help it. She's a wonder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who? Miss Orr?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! Say, Ellen, if you knew what that girl has gone
through, without a murmur; and now I'm afraid&mdash; By George! we
ought to spare her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; you and I. You can do a lot to help, Ellen, if you
will. That old man you saw is sick, hardly sane. And no
wonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped short and stared fixedly at his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you guess who he was?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Ellen reflected. &ldquo;I can guess&mdash;if you'll give me
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim made an impatient gesture. &ldquo;That's just what I
thought,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;There'll be the devil to pay
generally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said Ellen earnestly, &ldquo;if we are to help
her, you must tell me all about that old man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>She</em> wanted to tell everybody,&rdquo; he
recollected gloomily. &ldquo;And why not you? Imagine an innocent
child set apart from the world by another's crime, Ellen. See, if you
can, that child growing up, with but one thought, one ideal&mdash;the
welfare of that other person. Picture to yourself what it would be
like to live solely to make a great wrong right, and to save the
wrongdoer. Literally, Ellen, she has borne that man's grief and
carried his sorrow, as truly as any vaunted Saviour of the world. Can
you see it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;? Is <em>that</em> why she calls it
<em>Bolton</em> House? Of course! And that dreadful old man is&mdash;
But, Jim, everybody will find it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're right,&rdquo; he acknowledged. &ldquo;But they
mustn't find it out just yet. We must put it off till the man can
shake that hang-dog air of his. Why, he can't even walk decently.
Prison is written all over him. Thank God, she doesn't seem to see
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm so glad you told me, Jim,&rdquo; said Ellen gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won't say a word about this, will you, Ellen?&rdquo; he
asked anxiously. &ldquo;I can depend on you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me a little credit for decency and common
sense,&rdquo; replied Ellen.</p>

<p>Jim bent over the wheel and kissed her.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XIX</h4>

<p>Rain was falling in torrents, slanting past the windows of the old
parsonage in long gray lines, gurgling up between loosened panes, and
drip-dropping resoundingly in the rusty pan the minister had set
under a broken spot in the ceiling. Upstairs a loosened shutter
banged intermittently under the impact of the wind, which howled
past, to lose itself with great commotion in the tops of the tall
evergreens in the churchyard. It was the sort of day when untoward
events, near and far, stand out with unpleasant prominence against
the background of one's everyday life. A day in which a man is led,
whether he will or not, to take stock of himself and to balance with
some care the credit and debit sides of his ledger.</p>

<p>Wesley Elliot had been working diligently on his sermon since nine
o'clock that morning, at which hour he had deserted Mrs. Solomon
Black's comfortable tight roof, to walk under the inadequate shelter
of a leaking umbrella to the parsonage.</p>

<p>Three closely written pages in the minister's neat firm
handwriting attested his uninterrupted diligence. At the top of the
fourth page he set a careful numeral, under it wrote
&ldquo;Thirdly,&rdquo; then paused, laid down his pen, yawned wearily
and gazed out at the dripping shrubbery. The rain had come too late
to help the farmers, he was thinking. It was always that way: too
much sunshine and dry weather; then too much rain&mdash;floods of it,
deluges of it.</p>

<p>He got up from his chair, stretched his cramped limbs and began
marching up and down the floor. He had fully intended to get away
from Brookville before another winter set in. But there were reasons
why he felt in no hurry to leave the place. He compelled himself to
consider them.</p>

<p>Was he in love with Lydia Orr? Honestly, he didn't know. He had
half thought he was, for a whole month, during which Lydia had faced
him across Mrs. Solomon Black's table three times a day.</p>

<p>As he walked up and down, he viewed the situation. Lydia had
declared, not once but often, that she wanted friends. Women always
talked that way, and meant otherwise. But did she? The minister shook
his head dubiously. He thought of Lydia Orr, of her beauty, of her
elusive sweetness. He was ashamed to think of her money, but he owned
to himself that he did.</p>

<p>Then he left his study and rambled about the chill rooms of the
lower floor. From the windows of the parlor, where he paused to stare
out, he could look for some distance up the street. He noticed dully
the double row of maples from which yellowed leaves were already
beginning to fall and the ugly fronts of houses, behind their shabby
picket fences. A wagon was creaking slowly through a shallow sea of
mud which had been dust the day before: beyond the hunched figure of
the teamster not a human being was in sight. Somewhere, a dog barked
fitfully and was answered by other dogs far away; and always the
shutter banged at uncertain intervals upstairs. This nuisance, at
least, could be abated. He presently located the shutter and closed
it; then, because its fastening had rusted quite away, sought for a
bit of twine in his pocket and was about to tie it fast when the wind
wrenched it again from his hold. As he thrust a black-coated arm from
the window to secure the unruly disturber of the peace he saw a man
fumbling with the fastening of the parsonage gate. Before he could
reach the foot of the stairs the long unused doorbell jangled
noisily.</p>

<p>He did not recognize the figure which confronted him on the stoop,
when at last he succeeded in undoing the door. The man wore a
raincoat turned up about his chin and the soft brim of a felt hat
dripped water upon its close-buttoned front.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, good-morning, sir!&rdquo; said the stranger,
as if his words had awaited the opening of the door with scant
patience. &ldquo;You are the&mdash;er&mdash;local clergyman, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At uncertain periods Wesley Elliot had been visited by a migratory
<i>colporteur</i>, and less frequently by impecunious persons
representing themselves to be fellow warriors on the walls of Zion,
temporarily out of ammunition. In the brief interval during which he
convoyed the stranger from the chilly obscurity of the hall to the
dubious comfort of his study, he endeavored to place his visitor in
one of these two classes, but without success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn't stop for an umbrella,&rdquo; explained the man,
rubbing his hands before the stove, in which the minister was
striving to kindle a livelier blaze.</p>

<p>Divested of his dripping coat and hat he appeared somewhat stooped
and feeble; he coughed slightly, as he gazed about the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's the matter here?&rdquo; he inquired abruptly;
&ldquo;don't they pay you your salary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The minister explained in brief his slight occupancy of the
parsonage; whereat the stranger shook his head:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's wrong&mdash;all wrong,&rdquo; he pronounced:
&ldquo;A parson should be married and have children&mdash;plenty of
them. Last time I was here, couldn't hear myself speak there was such
a racket of children in the hall. Mother sick upstairs, and the kids
sliding down the banisters like mad. I left the parson a check; poor
devil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He appeared to fall into a fit of musing, his eyes on the
floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you're wondering who I am, young man,&rdquo; he said
presently. &ldquo;Well, we're coming to that, presently. I want some
advice; so I shall merely put the case baldly.... I wanted advice,
before; but the parson of that day couldn't give me the right sort.
Good Lord! I can see him yet: short man, rather stout and baldish.
Meant well, but his religion wasn't worth a bean to me that day....
Religion is all very well to talk about on a Sunday; broadcloth coat,
white tie and that sort of thing; good for funerals, too, when a
man's dead and can't answer back. Sometimes I've amused myself
wondering what a dead man would say to a parson, if he could sit up
in his coffin and talk five minutes of what's happened to him since
they called him dead. Interesting to think of&mdash;eh? ...Had lots
of time to think.... Thought of most everything that ever happened;
and more that didn't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a stranger in Brookville, sir?&rdquo; observed
Wesley Elliot, politely.</p>

<p>He had already decided that the man was neither a
<i>colporteur</i> nor a clerical mendicant; his clothes were too
good, for one thing.</p>

<p>The man laughed, a short, unpleasant sound which ended in a fit of
coughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A stranger in Brookville?&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;Well;
not precisely.... But never mind that, young man. Now, you're a
clergyman, and on that account supposed to have more than ordinary
good judgment: what would you advise a man to do, who
had&mdash;er&mdash;been out of active life for a number of years. In
a hospital, we'll say, incapacitated, very much so. When he comes
out, he finds himself quite pleasantly situated, in a way; good home,
and all that sort of thing; but not allowed to&mdash;to use his
judgment in any way. Watched&mdash;yes, watched, by a person who
ought to know better. It's intolerable&mdash;intolerable! Why, you'll
not believe me when I tell you I'm obliged to sneak out of my own
house on the sly&mdash;on the sly, you understand, for the purpose of
taking needful exercise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped short and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief, the
fineness of which the minister noted mechanically&mdash;with other
details which had before escaped him; such as the extreme, yellowish
pallor of the man's face and hands and the extraordinary swiftness
and brightness of his eyes. He was conscious of growing uneasiness as
he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds very unpleasant, sir; but as I am not in
possession of the facts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I just told you,&rdquo; interrupted the stranger.
&ldquo;Didn't I say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn't make clear to me what the motives of this person
who tries to control your movements are. You didn't tell
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man moved his hand before his face, like one trying to brush
away imaginary flies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose she has her motives,&rdquo; he said fretfully.
&ldquo;And very likely they're good. I'll not deny that. But I can't
make her see that this constant espionage&mdash;this everlasting
watchfulness is not to be borne. I want freedom, and by God I'll have
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sprang from his chair and began pacing the room.</p>

<p>Wesley Elliot stared at his visitor without speaking. He perceived
that the man dragged his feet, as if from excessive fatigue or
weakness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had no thought of such a thing,&rdquo; the stranger went
on. &ldquo;I'd planned, as a man will who looks forward to release
from&mdash;from a hospital, how I'd go about and see my old
neighbors. I wanted to have them in for dinners and
luncheons&mdash;people I haven't seen for years. She knows them. She
can't excuse herself on that ground. She knows you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped short and eyed the minister, a slow grin spreading over
his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last time you were at my house I had a good mind to
walk in and make your acquaintance, then and there. I heard you
talking to her. You admire my daughter: that's easy to see; and she's
not such a bad match, everything considered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded the young man sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a man who's been dead and buried these eighteen
years,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;But I'm alive
still&mdash;very much alive; and they'll find it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An ugly scowl distorted the man's pale face. For an instant he
stared past Wesley Elliot, his eyes resting on an irregular splotch
of damp on the wall. Then he shook himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm alive,&rdquo; he repeated slowly. &ldquo;And I'm
free!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked the minister for the second
time.</p>

<p>For all his superior height and the sinewy strength of his young
shoulders he began to be afraid of the man who had come to him out of
the storm. There was something strangely disconcerting, even
sinister, in the ceaseless movements of his pale hands and the sudden
lightning dart of his eyes, as they shifted from the defaced wall to
his own perturbed face.</p>

<p>By way of reply the man burst into a disagreeable cackle of
laughter:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stopped in at the old bank building on my way,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Got it all fixed up for a reading room and library.
Quite a nice idea for the villagers. I'd planned something of the
sort, myself. Approve of that sort of thing for a rural population.
Who&mdash;was the benefactor in this case&mdash;eh? Take it for
granted the villagers didn't do it for themselves. The women in
charge there referred me to you for information.... Don't be in
haste, young man. I'll answer your question in good time. Who gave
the library, fixed up the building and all that? Must have cost
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The minister sat down with an assumption of ease he did not feel,
facing the stranger who had already possessed himself of the one
comfortable chair in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The library,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was given to the
village by a Miss Orr, a young woman who has recently settled in
Brookville. She has done a good deal for the place, in various
ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ways?&rdquo; asked the stranger, with an air of
interest.</p>

<p>Wesley Elliot enumerated briefly the number of benefits: the
purchase and rebuilding of the old Bolton house, the construction of
the waterworks, at present under way, the library and reading room,
with the town hall above. &ldquo;There are,&rdquo; he stated,
&ldquo;other things which might be mentioned; such as the improvement
of the village green, repairs on the church, the beginning of a fund
for lighting the streets, as well as innumerable smaller
benefactions, involving individuals in and around
Brookville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man listened alertly. When the minister paused, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young woman you speak of appears to have a deep
pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The minister did not deny this. And the man spoke again, after a
period of frowning silence:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was her idea?&mdash; Orr, you said her name
was?&mdash;in doing all this for Brookville? Rather
remarkable&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His tone, like his words, was mild and commonplace; but his face
wore an ugly sneering look, which enraged the minister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Orr's motive for thus benefiting a wretched community,
well-nigh ruined years ago by the villainy of one man, should be held
sacred from criticism,&rdquo; he said, with heat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let me tell you the girl had a motive&mdash;or
thought she had,&rdquo; said the stranger unpleasantly. &ldquo;But
she had no right to spend her money that way. You spoke just now of
the village as being ruined years ago by the villainy of one man.
That's a lie! The village ruined the man.... Never looked at it that
way; did you? Andrew Bolton had the interests of this place more
deeply at heart than any other human being ever did. He was the one
public-spirited man in the place.... Do you know who built your
church, young man? I see you don't. Well, Andrew Bolton built it,
with mighty little help from your whining, hypocritical church
members. Every Tom, Dick and Harry, for miles about; every old maid
with a book to sell; every cause&mdash;as they call the thousand and
one pious schemes to line their own pockets&mdash;every damned one of
'em came to Andrew Bolton for money, and he gave it to them. He was
no hoarding skinflint; not he. Better for him if he had been. When
luck went against him, as it did at last, these precious villagers
turned on him like a pack of wolves. They killed his wife; stripped
his one child of everything&mdash;even to the bed she slept in; and
the man himself they buried alive under a mountain of stone and iron,
where he rotted for eighteen years!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger's eyes were glaring with maniacal fury; he shook a
tremulous yellow finger in the other's face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talk about ruin!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Talk about one
man's villainy! This damnable village deserves to be razed off the
face of the earth! ...But I meant to forgive them. I was willing to
call the score even.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A nameless fear had gripped the younger man by the throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you&mdash;?&rdquo; he began; but could not speak the
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; said the stranger, with astonishing
composure, in view of his late fury, &ldquo;is Andrew Bolton; and the
girl you have been praising and&mdash;courting&mdash;is my daughter.
Now you see what a sentimental fool a woman can be. Well; I'll have
it out with her. I'll live here in Brookville on equal terms with my
neighbors. If there was ever a debt between us, it's been paid to the
uttermost farthing. I've paid it in flesh and blood and manhood. Is
there any money&mdash;any property you can name worth eighteen years
of a man's life? And such years&mdash; God! such years!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wesley Elliot stared. At last he understood the girl, and as he
thought of her shrinking aloofness standing guard over her eager
longing for friends&mdash;for affection, something hot and wet
blurred his eyes. He was scarcely conscious that the man, who had
taken to himself the name with which he had become hatefully familiar
during his years in Brookville, was still speaking, till a startling
sentence or two aroused him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's no reason under heaven why you should not marry
her, if you like. Convict's daughter? Bah! I snap my fingers in their
faces. My girl shall be happy yet. I swear it! But we'll stop all
this sickly sentimentality about the money. We'll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The minister held up a warning hand.</p>

<p>An immense yearning pity for Lydia had taken possession of him;
but for the man who had thus risen from a dishonorable grave to
blight her girlhood he felt not a whit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd better keep quiet,&rdquo; he said sternly.
&ldquo;You'd far better go away and leave her to live her life
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd like that; wouldn't you?&rdquo; said Bolton
dryly.</p>

<p>He leaned forward and stared the young man in the eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she wouldn't have it that way. Do you know that girl of
mine wouldn't hear of it. She expects to make it up to me.... Imagine
making up eighteen years of hell with a few pet names, a soft bed
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Wesley Elliot, with a gesture of
loathing. &ldquo;I can't listen to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you'll marry her&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bolton's voice again dropped into a whining monotone. He even
smiled deprecatingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'll excuse my ranting a bit, sir. It's natural after
what I've gone through. You've never been in a prison, maybe. And you
don't know what it's like to shake the bars of a cell at midnight and
howl out of sheer madness to be off and away&mdash;somewhere,
anywhere!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leaned forward and touched the minister on the knee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that brings me back to my idea in coming to see you.
I'm a level-headed man, still&mdash;quite cool and collected, as you
see&mdash;and I've been thinking the situation over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew his brows together and stared hard at the minister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've a proposition to make to you&mdash;as man to man.
Can't talk reason to a woman; there's no reason in a woman's
make-up&mdash;just sentiment and affection and imagination: an
impossible combination, when there are hard realities to face.... I
see you don't agree with me; but never mind that; just hear what I
have to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he appeared in no haste to go on, for all the eagerness of his
eyes and those pallid, restless hands. The minister got quickly to
his feet. The situation was momentarily becoming intolerable; he must
have time to think it over, he told himself, and determine his own
relations to this new and unwelcome parishioner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm very sorry, sir,&rdquo; he began;
&ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of that,&rdquo; growled Bolton. &ldquo;Sit down, young
man, and listen to what I have to say to you. We may not have another
chance like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His assumption of a common interest between them was most
distasteful; but for all that the minister resumed his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, as I've told you, my daughter appears unwilling to
allow me out of her sight. She tries to cover her watchfulness under
a pretense of solicitude for my health. I'm not well, of course; was
knocked down and beaten about the head by one of those devils in the
prison&mdash; Can't call them men: no decent man would choose to earn
his living that way. But cosseting and coddling in a warm house will
never restore me. I want freedom&mdash;nothing less. I must be out
and away when the mood seizes me night or day. Her affection stifles
me at times.... You can't understand that, of course; you think I'm
ungrateful, no doubt; and that I ought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You appear to me, a monster of selfishness,&rdquo; Wesley
Elliot broke in. &ldquo;You ought to stop thinking of yourself and
think of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bolton's face drew itself into the mirthless wrinkles which passed
for a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm coming to that,&rdquo; he said with some eagerness.
&ldquo;I do think of her; and that's why&mdash; Can't you see, man,
that eighteen years of prison don't grow the domestic virtues? A
monster of selfishness? You're dead right. I'm all of that; and I'm
too old to change. I can't play the part of a doting father. I
thought I could, before I got out; but I can't. Twice I've been
tempted to knock her down, when she stood between me and the door....
Keep cool; I didn't do it! But I'm afraid of myself, I tell you. I've
got to have my liberty. She can have hers.... Now here's my
proposition: Lydia's got money. I don't know how much. My
brother-in-law was a close man. Never even knew he was rich. But
she's got it&mdash;all but what she's spent here trying to square
accounts, as she thought. Do they thank her for it? Not much. I know
them! But see here, you marry Lydia, whenever you like; then give me
ten thousand dollars, and I'll clear out. I'm not a desirable
father-in-law; I know that, as well as you do. But I'll guarantee to
disappear, once my girl is settled. Is it a bargain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elliot shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your daughter doesn't love me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Bolton flung up his hand in an impatient gesture of dissent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stood in the way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She was thinking
of me, don't you see? But if I get out&mdash; Oh, I promise you I'll
make myself scarce, once this matter is settled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you propose is impossible, on the face of it,&rdquo;
the minister said slowly. &ldquo;I am sorry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible! Why impossible?&rdquo; shouted Bolton, in a
sudden fury. &ldquo;You've been courting my daughter&mdash;don't try
to crawl out of it, now you know what I am. I'll not stand in the
way, I tell you. Why, the devil&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped short, his restless eyes roving over the young man's
face and figure:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;I begin to understand:
&lsquo;the sanctity of the cloth&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;my sacred
calling&rsquo;&mdash; Yes, yes! And perhaps my price seems a bit
high: ten thousand dollars&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elliot sprang from his chair and stood over the cringing figure of
the ex-convict.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could strike you,&rdquo; he said in a smothered voice;
&ldquo;but you are an old man and&mdash;not responsible. You don't
understand what you've said, perhaps; and I'll not try to make you
see it as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I supposed you were fond of my girl,&rdquo; mumbled Bolton.
&ldquo;I heard you tell her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the look in the younger man's eyes stopped him. His hand
sought his heart in an uncertain gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any brandy?&rdquo; he asked feebly.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I'm not well.... No matter; I'll go over to the
tavern. I'll have them take me home. Tired, after all this; don't
feel like walking.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XX</h4>

<p>The minister from the doorstep of the parsonage watched the
stooped figure as it shambled down the street. The rain was still
falling in torrents. The thought crossed his mind that the old man
might not be able to compass the two miles or more of country road.
Then he got into his raincoat and followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My umbrella isn't of the best,&rdquo; he said, as he
overtook the toiling figure; &ldquo;but I should have offered
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew Bolton muttered something unintelligible, as he glanced up
at the poor shelter the young man held over him. As he did not offer
to avail himself of it the minister continued to walk at his side,
accommodating his long free stride to the curious shuffling gait of
the man who had spent eighteen years in prison. And so they passed
the windowed fronts of the village houses, peering out from the
dripping autumnal foliage like so many watchful eyes, till the hoarse
signal of a motor car halted them, as they were about to cross the
street in front of the Brookville House.</p>

<p>From the open door of the car Lydia Orr's pale face looked
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, father,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I've been looking for
you everywhere!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not appear to see the minister.</p>

<p>Bolton stepped into the car with a grunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to see the old black Maria, for once,&rdquo; he
chuckled. &ldquo;Don't you recognize the parson, my dear? Nice
fellow&mdash;the parson; been having quite a visit with him at the
manse. Old stamping-ground of mine, you know. Always friendly with
the parson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wesley Elliot had swept the hat from his head. Lydia's eyes, blue
and wide like those of a frightened child, met his with an anguished
question.</p>

<p>He bowed gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have brought him home quite safe,&rdquo; he told
her. &ldquo;I intended ordering a carriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl's lips shaped formal words of gratitude. Then the
obedient humming of the motor deepened to a roar and the car glided
swiftly away.</p>

<p>On the opposite corner, her bunched skirts held high, stood Miss
Lois Daggett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please wait a minute, Mr. Elliot,&rdquo; she called.
&ldquo;I'll walk right along under your umbrella, if you don't
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wesley Elliot bowed and crossed the street.
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know why I didn't bring my own umbrella this
morning,&rdquo; said Miss Daggett with a keen glance at Elliot.
&ldquo;That old man stopped in the library awhile ago, and he rather
frightened me. He looked very odd and talked so queer. Did he come to
the parsonage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Wesley Elliot. &ldquo;He came to the
parsonage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you who he was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had expected this question. But how should he answer it?</p>

<p>&ldquo;He told me he had been ill for a long time,&rdquo; said the
minister evasively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ill!&rdquo; repeated Miss Daggett shrilly. Then she said
one word: &ldquo;Insane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People who are insane are not likely to mention it,&rdquo;
said Elliot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he is insane,&rdquo; said Miss Daggett with
conviction.</p>

<p>Wesley looked at her meditatively. Would the truth, the whole
truth, openly proclaimed, be advisable at this juncture, he wondered.
Lydia could not hope to keep her secret long. And there was danger in
her attempt. He shuddered as he remembered the man's terrible words,
&ldquo;Twice I have been tempted to knock her down when she stood
between me and the door.&rdquo;  Would it not be better to abandon
this pretense sooner, rather than later? If the village knew the
truth, would not the people show at least a semblance of kindness to
the man who had expiated so bitterly the wrong he had done them?</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the man is insane,&rdquo; Miss Daggett said, &ldquo;it
doesn't seem right to me to have him at large.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew what to do,&rdquo; said Elliot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you ought to tell what you know if the man is
insane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I will tell,&rdquo; said Elliot, almost fiercely.
&ldquo;That man is Andrew Bolton. He has come home after eighteen
years of imprisonment, which have left him terribly weak in mind and
body. Don't you think people will forgive him now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A swift vindictiveness flashed into the woman's face. &ldquo;I
don't know,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why in the world don't you know, Miss Daggett?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the true reason for the woman's rancor was disclosed. It was
a reason as old as the human race, a suspicion as old as the human
race, which she voiced. &ldquo;I have said from the first,&rdquo; she
declared, &ldquo;that nobody would come here, as that girl did, and
do so much unless she had a motive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elliot stared at her. &ldquo;Then you hate that poor child for
trying to make up for the wrong her father did; and that, and not his
wrongdoing, influences you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Daggett stared at him. Her face slowly reddened. &ldquo;I
wouldn't put it that way,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What way would you put it?&rdquo; demanded Elliot
mercilessly. He was so furious that he forgot to hold the umbrella
over Miss Daggett, and the rain drove in her hard, unhappy face. She
did not seem to notice. She had led a poisoned life, in a narrow rut
of existence, and toxic emotions had become as her native atmosphere
of mind. Now she seemed to be about to breathe in a better air of
humanity, and she choked under it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;that was&mdash;her
reason, but&mdash;I always felt&mdash;that nobody ever did such
things without&mdash;as they used to say&mdash;an ax to
grind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This seems to me a holy sort of ax,&rdquo; said Elliot
grimly, &ldquo;and one for which a Christian woman should certainly
not fling stones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had reached the Daggett house. The woman stopped short.
&ldquo;You needn't think I'm going around talking, any more than you
would,&rdquo; she said, and her voice snapped like a whip. She went
up the steps, and Elliot went home, not knowing whether he had
accomplished good or mischief.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XXI</h4>

<p>Much to Mrs. Solomon Black's astonishment, Wesley Elliot ate no
dinner that day. It was his habit to come in from a morning's work
with a healthy young appetite keen-set for her beef and vegetables.
He passed directly up to his room, although she called to him that
dinner was ready. Finally she went upstairs and knocked smartly on
his door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dinner's ready, Mr. Elliot,&rdquo; she called out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't want any today, thank you, Mrs. Black,&rdquo; was
his reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ain't sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, only not hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Black was alarmed when, later in the afternoon, she heard the
front door slam, and beheld from a front window Elliot striding down
the street. The rain had ceased falling, and there were ragged holes
in the low-hanging clouds which revealed glimpses of dazzling
blue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do hope he ain't coming down with a fever or
something,&rdquo; Mrs. Black said aloud. Then she saw Mrs. Deacon
Whittle, Lois Daggett, Mrs. Fulsom, and the wife of the postmaster
approaching her house in the opposite direction. All appeared flushed
and agitated, and Mrs. Black hastened to open her door, as she saw
them hurrying up her wet gravel path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the minister home?&rdquo; demanded Lois Daggett
breathlessly. &ldquo;I want he should come right down here and tell
you what he told me this noon. Abby Daggett seems to think I made it
up out of whole cloth. Don't deny it, Abby. You know very well you
said.... I s'pose of course he's told you, Mrs. Black.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Elliot has gone out,&rdquo; said Mrs. Black rather
coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's he gone?&rdquo; demanded Lois.</p>

<p>Mrs. Black was being devoured with curiosity; still she felt
vaguely repelled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; she said, her air of reserve deepening.
&ldquo;I don't know what you are talking about, but Mr. Elliot didn't
eat any dinner, and he is either sick or troubled in his
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! Now you c'n all see from that!&rdquo; triumphed Lois
Daggett.</p>

<p>Mrs. Deacon Whittle and Mrs. Judge Fulsom gazed incredulously at
Mrs. Solomon Black, then at one another.</p>

<p>Abby Daggett, the soft round of her beautiful, kind face flushed
and tremulous, murmured: &ldquo;Poor man&mdash;poor man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Solomon Black with a masterly gesture headed the women toward
her parlor, where a fire was burning in a splendidly nickeled stove
full five feet high.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;we'll talk this over, whatever
it is.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XXII</h4>

<p>A mile from town, where the angry wind could be seen at work
tearing the purple rainclouds into rags and tatters, through which
the hidden sun shot long rays of pale splendor, Wesley Elliot was
walking rapidly, his head bent, his eyes fixed and absent.</p>

<p>He had just emerged from one of those crucial experiences of life,
which, more than the turning of the earth upon its axis, serve to age
a human being. For perhaps the first time in the brief span of his
remembrance, he had scrutinized himself in the pitiless light of an
intelligence higher than his own everyday consciousness; and the
sight of that meaner self, striving to run to cover, had not been
pleasant. Just why his late interview with Andrew Bolton should have
precipitated this event, he could not possibly have explained to any
one&mdash;and least of all to himself. He had begun, logically
enough, with an illuminating review of the motives which led him into
the ministry; they were a sorry lot, on the whole; but his subsequent
ambitions appeared even worse. For the first time, he perceived his
own consummate selfishness set over against the shining renunciations
of his mother. Then, step by step, he followed his career in
Brookville: his smug satisfaction in his own good looks; his shallow
pride and vanity over the vapid insincerities he had perpetrated
Sunday after Sunday in the shabby pulpit of the Brookville church;
his Pharisaical relations with his people; his utter misunderstanding
of their needs. All this proved poignant enough to force the big
drops to his forehead.... There were other aspects of himself at
which he scarcely dared look in his utter abasement of spirit; those
dark hieroglyphics of the beast-self which appear on the whitest
soul. He had supposed himself pure and saintly because, forsooth, he
had concealed the arena of these primal passions beneath the surface
of this outward life, chaining them there like leashed tigers in the
dark.... Two faces of women appeared to be looking on, while he
strove to unravel the snarl of his self-knowledge. Lydia's unworldly
face, wearing a faint nimbus of unimagined self-immolation, and
Fanny's&mdash;full of love and solicitude, the face which he had
almost determined to forget.</p>

<p>He was going to Lydia. Every newly awakened instinct of his
manhood bade him go.</p>

<p>She came to him at once, and without pretense of concealment began
to speak of her father. She trembled a little as she asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He told you who he was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without waiting for his answer she gravely corrected herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have said, who <em>we</em> are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled a faint apology:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have always been called Lydia Orr; it was my mother's
name. I was adopted into my uncle's family, after father&mdash;went
to prison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her blue eyes met his pitying gaze without evasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think I shall
be glad&mdash;to have every one know. I meant to tell them all, at
first. But when I found&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>Then because as yet he had said nothing to comfort her, or
himself; and because every word that came bubbling to the surface
appeared banal and inadequate, he continued silent, gazing at her and
marveling at her perfect serenity&mdash;her absolute poise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be a relief,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;When every
one knows. He dislikes to be watched. I have been afraid&mdash;I
could not bear to have him know how they hate him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he forced himself to say, &ldquo;they will
not hate him, when they know how you&mdash; Lydia, you are
wonderful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up startled and put out her hand as if to prevent him
from speaking further.</p>

<p>But the words came in a torrent now:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How you must despise me! I despise myself. I am not worthy,
Lydia; but if you can care&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she said softly, as if she would lay the
compelling finger of silence upon his lips. &ldquo;I told you I was
not like other women. Can't you see&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must marry me,&rdquo; he urged, in a veritable passion
of self-giving. &ldquo;I want to help you! You will let me,
Lydia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could not help me; I am better alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him, the glimmer of a smile dawning in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not love me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;nor I you. You
are my friend. You will remain my friend, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She arose and held out her hand. He took it without a word. And so
they stood for a moment; each knowing without need of speech what the
other was thinking; the man sorry and ashamed because he could not
deny the truth of her words; and she compassionately willing to draw
the veil of a soothing silence over his hurts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to tell you&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>But she shook her head:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to tell me anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; he said bitterly, &ldquo;that you saw
through my shallow pretenses all the while. I know now how you must
have despised me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it nothing that you have asked me&mdash;a convict's
daughter&mdash;to be your wife?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Do you think
I don't know that some men would have thanked heaven for their escape
and never spoken to me again? I can't tell you how it has helped to
hearten me for what must come. I shall not soon forget that you
offered me your self&mdash;your career; it would have cost you that.
I want you to know how much I&mdash;appreciate what you have done, in
offering me the shelter of an honest name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He would have uttered some unavailing words of protest, but she
checked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall both be glad of this, some day,&rdquo; she
predicted gravely.... &ldquo;There is one thing you can do for
me,&rdquo; she added: &ldquo;Tell them. It will be best for both of
us, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was already done, he said, explaining his motives in short,
disjointed sentences.</p>

<p>Then with a feeling of relief which he strove to put down, but
which nevertheless persisted in making itself felt in a curious
lightening of his spirits, he was again walking rapidly and without
thought of his destination. Somber bars of crimson and purple crossed
the west, and behind them, flaming up toward the zenith in a
passionate splendor of light, streamed long, golden rays from out the
heart of that glory upon which no human eye may look. The angry wind
had fallen to quiet, and higher up, floating in a sea of purest
violet, those despised and flouted rags of clouds were seen,
magically changed to rose and silver.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XXIII</h4>

<p>Fanny Dodge sat by the pleasant west window of the kitchen,
engaged in reading those aimless shreds of local information which
usually make up the outside pages of the weekly newspaper. She could
not possibly feel the slightest interest in the fact that Mr. and
Mrs. James M. Snider of West Schofield were entertaining a daughter,
whose net weight was reported to be nine and three quarters pounds;
or that Miss Elizabeth Wardwell of Eltingville had just issued
beautifully engraved invitations to her wedding, which was to take
place on the seventeenth day of October&mdash;yet she went on
reading. Everybody read the paper. Sometimes they talked about what
they read. Anyway, her work was over for the day&mdash;all except
tea, which was negligible; so she went on, somewhat drearily
suppressing a yawn, to a description of the new water-works, which
were being speedily brought to completion in &ldquo;our neighboring
enterprising town of Brookville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny already knew all there was to tell concerning the concrete
reservoir on the mountain, the big conduit leading to the village and
the smaller pipes laid wherever there were householders desiring
water. These were surprisingly few, considering the fact that there
would be no annual charge for the water, beyond the insignificant sum
required for its up-keep. People said their wells were good enough
for them; and that spring water wasn't as good as cistern water, when
it came to washing. Some were of the opinion that Lydia Orr was in a
fool's hurry to get rid of her money; others that she couldn't stand
it to be out of the limelight; and still other sagacious individuals
felt confident there was something in it for &ldquo;that girl.&rdquo;
 Fanny had heard these various views of Miss Orr's conduct. She was
still striving with indifferent success to rise above her jealousy,
and to this end she never failed to champion Lydia's cause against
all comers. Curiously enough, this course had finally brought her
tranquillity of a sort and an utter unprotesting acquiescence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whittle had been overheard saying to Mrs. Fulsom that she
guessed, after all, Fanny Dodge didn't care so much about the
minister.</p>

<p>Fanny, deep once more in the absorbing consideration of the
question which had once been too poignant to consider calmly, and the
answer to which she was never to know, permitted the paper to slide
off her knee to the floor: Why had Wesley Elliot so suddenly deserted
her? Surely, he could not have fallen in love with another woman; she
was sure he had been in love with her. However, to kiss and forget
might be one of the inscrutable ways of men. She was really afraid it
was. But Wesley Elliot had never kissed her; had never even held her
hand for more than a minute at a time. But those minutes loomed large
in retrospect.</p>

<p>The clock struck five and Fanny, roused from her reverie by the
sudden sound, glanced out of the window. At the gate she saw Elliot.
He stood there, gazing at the house as if uncertain whether to enter
or not. Fanny put up a tremulous hand to her hair, which was pinned
fast in its accustomed crisp coils; then she glanced down at her blue
gown.... Yes; he was coming in! The bell hanging over the passage
door jangled shrilly. Fanny stood stock-still in the middle of the
floor, staring at it. There was no fire in the parlor. She would be
forced to bring him out to the kitchen. She thought of the wide,
luxuriously furnished rooms of Bolton house and unconsciously her
face hardened. She might pretend she did not hear the bell. She might
allow him to go away, thinking none of the family were at home. She
pictured him, standing there on the doorstep facing the closed door;
and a perverse spirit held her silent, while the clock ticked
resoundingly. Then all at once with a smothered cry she hurried
through the hall, letting the door fall to behind her with a loud
slam.</p>

<p>He was waiting patiently on the doorstep, as she had pictured him;
and before a single word had passed between them she knew that the
stone had been rolled away. His eyes met hers, not indeed with the
old look, but with another, incomprehensible, yet wonderfully
soul-satisfying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to tell you about it, before it came to you from
the outside,&rdquo; he said, when they had settled themselves in the
warm, silent kitchen.</p>

<p>His words startled Fanny. Was he going to tell her of his
approaching marriage to Lydia? Her color faded, and a look of almost
piteous resignation drooped the corners of her mouth. She strove to
collect her scattered wits, to frame words of congratulation with
which to meet the dreaded avowal.</p>

<p>He appeared in no hurry to begin; but bent forward, his eyes upon
her changing face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you know, already,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;She
may have told your brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you speaking of Miss Orr?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice sounded strange in her own ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;But I suppose one should
give her her rightful name, from now on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I hadn't heard,&rdquo; said Fanny, feeling her
hard-won courage slipping from her. &ldquo;Jim didn't tell me. But of
course I am not&mdash;surprised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He evidently experienced something of the emotion she had just
denied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one seemed to have guessed it,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;But now everything is plain. Poor girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He fell into a fit of musing, which he finally broke to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you would go to see her. She sorely needs
friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has&mdash;you,&rdquo; said Fanny in a smothered
voice.</p>

<p>For the life of her she could not withhold that one lightning
flash out of her enveloping cloud.</p>

<p>He disclaimed her words with a swift gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm not worthy to claim her friendship, nor yours,&rdquo;
he said humbly; &ldquo;but I hope you&mdash;sometime you may be able
to forgive me, Fanny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think I understand what you have come to tell
me,&rdquo; she said with difficulty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The village is ringing with the news. She wanted every one
to know; her father has come home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you didn't guess, after all. I think we were all blind.
Andrew Bolton has come back to Brookville, a miserable, broken
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you said&mdash;her father. Do you mean that Lydia
Orr&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn't a deliberate deception on her part,&rdquo; he
interrupted quickly. &ldquo;She has always been known as Lydia Orr.
It was her mother's name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny despised herself for the unreasoning tumult of joy which
surged up within her. He could not possibly marry Andrew Bolton's
daughter!</p>

<p>He was watching her closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps, if she consented, I would marry Lydia
Orr,&rdquo; he forced himself to tell her. &ldquo;I want you to know
this from me, now. I decided that her money and her position would
help me.... I admired her; I even thought at one time I&mdash;loved
her. I tried to love her.... I am not quite so base as to marry
without love.... But she knew. She tried to save me.... Then her
father&mdash;that wretched, ruined man came to me. He told me
everything.... Fanny, that girl is a saint!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes were inscrutable under their somber brows. The girl
sitting stiffly erect, every particle of color drained from her young
face, watched him with something like terror. Why was he telling her
this?&mdash;Why? Why?</p>

<p>His next words answered her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can conceive of no worse punishment than having you think
ill of me.&rdquo; ... And after a pause: &ldquo;I deserve everything
you may be telling yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But coherent thought had become impossible for Fanny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don't you marry her?&rdquo; she asked clearly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I asked her. I knew I had been a cad to both of you. I
asked her all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny's fingers, locked rigidly in her lap, did not quiver. Her
blue eyes were wide and strange, but she tried to smile.</p>

<p>His voice, harsh and hesitating, went on: &ldquo;She refused me,
of course. She had known all along what I was. She said she did not
love me; that I did not love her&mdash;which was God's truth. I
wanted to atone. You see that, don't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at Fanny and started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God, Fanny!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I have made you
suffer too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny, can you love me and be my wife after all
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a woman,&rdquo; said Fanny. Her eyes blazed angrily at
him. Then she laughed and put up her mouth to be kissed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men will make fools of women till the Day of
Judgment,&rdquo; said she, and laughed again.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XXIV</h4>

<p>When the afternoon mail came in that day, Mr. Henry Daggett
retired behind his official barrier according to his wont, leaving
the store in charge of Joe Whittle, the Deacon's son. It had been
diligently pointed out to Joe by his thrifty parents that all rich
men began life by sweeping out stores and other menial tasks, and for
some time Joe had been working for Mr. Daggett with doubtful
alacrity.</p>

<p>Joe liked the store. There was a large stock of candy, dried
fruit, crackers and pickles; Joe was a hungry boy, and Mr. Daggett
had told him he could eat what he wished. He was an easy-going man
with no children of his own, and he took great delight in pampering
the Deacon's son. &ldquo;I told him he could eat candy and things,
and he looked tickled to death,&rdquo; he told his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He'll get his stomach upset,&rdquo; objected Mrs.
Daggett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can't eat the whole stock,&rdquo; said Daggett,
&ldquo;and upsetting a boy's stomach is not much of an upset anyway.
It don't take long to right it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once in a while Daggett would suggest to Joe that if he were in
his place he wouldn't eat too much of that green candy. He supposed
it was pure; he didn't mean to sell any but pure candy if he knew it,
but it might be just as well for him to go slow. Generally he took a
paternal delight in watching the growing boy eat his stock in
trade.</p>

<p>That afternoon Joe was working on a species of hard sweet which
distended his cheeks, and nearly deprived him temporarily of the
power of speech, while the people seeking their mail came in. There
was never much custom while mail-sorting was going on, and Joe sucked
blissfully.</p>

<p>Then Jim Dodge entered and spoke to him. &ldquo;Hullo, Joe,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>Joe nodded, speechless.</p>

<p>Jim seated himself on a stool, and lit his pipe.</p>

<p>Joe eyed him. Jim was a sort of hero to him on account of his
hunting fame. As soon as he could control his tongue, he addressed
him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heard the news?&rdquo; said he, trying to speak like a
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Andrew Bolton's got out of prison and come back. He's
crazy, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you get hold of such nonsense?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heard the women talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim pondered a moment. Then he said &ldquo;Damn,&rdquo; and Joe
admired him as never before. When Jim had gone out, directly, Joe
shook his fist at a sugar barrel, and said &ldquo;Damn,&rdquo; in a
whisper.</p>

<p>Jim in the meantime was hurrying along the road to the Bolton
house. He made up his mind that he must see Lydia. He must know if
she had authorized the revelation that had evidently been made, and
if so, through whom. He suspected the minister, and was hot with
jealousy. His own friendship with Lydia seemed to have suffered a
blight after that one confidential talk of theirs, in which she had
afforded him a glimpse of her sorrowful past. She had not alluded to
the subject a second time; and, somehow, he had not been able to get
behind the defenses of her smiling cheerfulness. Always she was with
her father, it seemed; and the old man, garrulous enough when alone,
was invariably silent and moody in his daughter's company. One might
almost have said he hated her, from the sneering impatient looks he
cast at her from time to time. As for Lydia, she was all love and
brooding tenderness for the man who had suffered so long and
terribly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He'll be better after a while,&rdquo; she constantly
excused him. &ldquo;He needs peace and quiet and home to restore him
to himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to look out for him,&rdquo; Jim had ventured to
warn the girl, when the two were alone together for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean father?&rdquo; Lydia asked. &ldquo;What else
should I do? It is all I live for&mdash;just to look out for
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Had she been a martyr bound to the stake, the faggots piled about
her slim body, her face might have worn just that expression of high
resignation and contempt for danger and suffering.</p>

<p>The young man walked slowly on. He wanted time to think.
Besides&mdash;he glanced down with a quick frown of annoyance at his
mud-splashed clothing&mdash;he certainly cut a queer figure for a
call.</p>

<p>Some one was standing on the doorstep talking to Fanny, as he
approached his own home. Another instant and he had recognized Wesley
Elliot. He stopped behind a clump of low-growing trees, and watched.
Fanny, framed in the dark doorway, glowed like a rose. Jim saw her
bend forward, smiling; saw the minister take both her hands in his
and kiss them; saw Fanny glance quickly up and down the empty road,
as if apprehensive of a chance passerby. Then the minister, his
handsome head bared to the cold wind, waved her farewell and started
at a brisk pace down the road.</p>

<p>Jim waited till the door had closed lingeringly on the girl; then
he stepped forth from his concealment and waited.</p>

<p>Abreast of him Elliot stopped; aware, it would seem, of the menace
in the other man's eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wished to speak with me?&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak with you&mdash;no! I want to kick you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The minister eyed him indignantly. &ldquo;What do you
mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sneaking hypocrite! do you think I don't know what has
happened? You threw Fanny down, when Lydia Orr came to town; you
thought my sister wasn't good enough&mdash;nor rich enough for a
handsome, eloquent clergyman like you. But when you learned her
father was a convict&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Elliot. &ldquo;You don't
understand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't? Well, I guess I come pretty near it. And not
content with telling Lydia's pitiful secret to all the busybodies in
town, you come to Fanny with your smug explanations. My God! I could
kill you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The minister's face had hardened during this speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are going too
far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you deny that you've made love to both my sister and
Miss Orr?&rdquo; demanded Jim.</p>

<p>Physically the minister was no coward. He measured the slight,
wiry figure of his wrathful opponent with a coolly appraising
eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My relations with Miss Orr are none of your
business,&rdquo; he reminded Jim. &ldquo;As for your
sister&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; cried Jim.</p>

<p>The minister shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you'll listen to reason,&rdquo; he suggested
pacifically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw you kiss my sister's hand! I tell you I'll not have
you hanging around the place, after what's gone. You may as well
understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wesley Elliot reflected briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's one thing you ought to know,&rdquo; he said,
controlling his desire to knock Fanny's brother into the bushes.</p>

<p>A scornful gesture bade him to proceed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andrew Bolton came to see me in the parsonage this morning.
He is a ruined man, in every sense of the word. He will never be
otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim Dodge thrust both hands deep in his trousers' pockets, his
eyes fixed and frowning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;what of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That being the case, all we can do is to make the best of
things&mdash;for her.... She requested me to make the facts known in
the village. They would have found out everything from the man
himself. He is&mdash;perhaps you are aware that Bolton bitterly
resents his daughter's interference. She would have been glad to
spare him the pain of publicity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The minister's tone was calm, even judicial; and Jim Dodge
suddenly experienced a certain flat humiliation of spirit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't know she asked you to tell,&rdquo; he muttered,
kicking a pebble out of the way. &ldquo;That puts a different face on
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He eyed the minister steadily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll be hanged if I can make you out, Elliot,&rdquo; he
said at last. &ldquo;You can't blame me for thinking&mdash; Why did
you come here this afternoon, anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sudden belated glimmer of comprehension dawned upon the
minister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you in love with Miss Orr?&rdquo; he parried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of your damned business!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was hoping you were,&rdquo; the minister said quietly.
&ldquo;She needs a friend&mdash;one who will stand close, just
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to marry Fanny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The minister smiled and held out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We may as well be friends, Jim,&rdquo; he said coolly,
&ldquo;seeing we're to be brothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man turned on his heel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll have to think that proposition over,&rdquo; he
growled. &ldquo;It's a bit too sudden&mdash;for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without another glance in the direction of the minister he marched
toward the house. Fanny was laying the table, a radiant color in her
face. A single glance told her brother that she was happy. He threw
himself into a chair by the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's mother?&rdquo; he asked presently, pretending to
ignore the excited flutter of the girl's hands as she set a plate of
bread on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She hasn't come back from the village yet,&rdquo; warbled
Fanny. She couldn't keep the joy in her soul from singing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess I'll eat my supper and get out. I don't want to hear
a word of gossip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny glanced up, faltered, then ran around the table and threw
her arms about Jim's neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim!&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;you've seen
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse luck!&rdquo; grumbled Jim.</p>

<p>He held his sister off at arm's length and gazed at her
fixedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you see in that chap,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim, he's wonderful!&rdquo; cried Fanny, half laughing,
half crying, and altogether lovely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you think so. But after the way he's treated
you&mdash; By George, Fan! I can't see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny drew herself up proudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I haven't talked much about it, Jim,&rdquo; she
said, with dignity; &ldquo;but Wesley and I had a&mdash;a little
misunderstanding. It's all explained away now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And to this meager explanation she stubbornly adhered, through
subsequent soul-searching conversations with her mother, and during
the years of married life that followed. In time she came to believe
it, herself; and the &ldquo;little misunderstanding with
Wesley&rdquo; and its romantic d&eacute;nouement became a
well-remembered milestone, wreathed with sentiment.</p>

<p>But poised triumphant on this pinnacle of joy, she yet had time to
think of another than herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said she, a touch of matronly authority already
apparent in her manner. &ldquo;I've wanted for a long time to talk to
you seriously about Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim stared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About Ellen?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim, she's awfully fond of you. I think you've treated her
cruelly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Fan,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;don't you worry
yourself about Ellen Dix. She's not in love with me, and never
was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, Jim would not say another word. He gulped down
his supper and was off. He kissed Fanny when he went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope you'll be happy, and all that,&rdquo; he told her
rather awkwardly. Fanny looked after him swinging down the road.
&ldquo;I guess it's all right between him and Ellen,&rdquo; she
thought.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XXV</h4>

<p>Jim had no definite plan as he tramped down the road in the
falling darkness. He felt uncertain and miserable as he speculated
with regard to Lydia. She could not guess at half the unkind things
people must be saying; but she would ask for the bread of sympathy
and they would give her a stone. He wished he might carry her away,
shielding her and comforting her against the storm. He knew he would
willingly give his life to make her happier. Of course she did not
care for him. How could she? Who was he&mdash;Jim Dodge&mdash;to
aspire to a girl like Lydia?</p>

<p>The wind had risen again and was driving dark masses of cloud
across the sky; in the west a sullen red flared up from behind the
hills, touching the lower edges of the vaporous mountains with
purple. In a small, clear space above the red hung the silver sickle
of the new moon, and near it shone a single star.... Lydia was like
that star, he told himself&mdash;as wonderful, as remote.</p>

<p>There were lights in the windows of Bolton House. Jim stopped and
gazed at the yellow squares, something big and powerful rising within
him. Then, yielding to a sudden impulse, he approached and looked in.
In a great armchair before the blazing hearth sat, or rather
crouched, Andrew Bolton. He was wearing a smoking-jacket of crimson
velvet and a pipe hung from his nerveless fingers. Only the man's
eyes appeared alive; they were fixed upon Lydia at the piano. She was
playing some light tuneful melody, with a superabundance of trills
and runs. Jim did not know Lydia played; and the knowledge of this
trivial accomplishment seemed to put her still further beyond his
reach. He did not know, either, that she had acquired her somewhat
indifferent skill after long years of dull practice, and for the
single purpose of diverting the man, who sat watching her with
bright, furtive eyes.... Presently she arose from the piano and
crossed the room to his side. She bent over him and kissed him on his
bald forehead, her white hands clinging to his shoulders. Jim saw the
man shake off those hands with a rough gesture; saw the grieved look
on her face; saw the man follow her slight figure with his eyes, as
she stooped under pretext of mending the fire. But he could not hear
the words which passed between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You pretend to love me,&rdquo; Bolton was saying.
&ldquo;Why don't you do what I want you to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you'd like to go away from Brookville, father, I will go
with you. You need me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's where you're dead wrong, my girl: I don't need you.
What I do need is freedom! You stifle me with your fussy attentions.
Give me some money; I'll go away and not bother you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereat Lydia had cried out&mdash;a little hurt cry, which reached
the ears of the watcher outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't leave me, father! I have no one but you in all the
world&mdash;no one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you've never even told me how much money you
have,&rdquo; the man went on in a whining voice. &ldquo;There's
daughterly affection for you! By rights it all ought to be mine. I've
suffered enough, God knows, to deserve a little comfort
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that I have is yours, father. I want nothing for
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then hand it over&mdash;the control of it, I mean. I'll
make you a handsome allowance; and I'll give you this place, too. I
don't want to rot here.... Marry that good-looking parson and settle
down, if you like. I don't want to settle down: been settled in one
cursed place long enough, by gad! I should think you could see
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you wanted to come home to Brookville, father. Don't
you remember you said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was when I was back there in that hell-hole, and
didn't know what I wanted. How could I? I only wanted to get out.
That's what I want now&mdash;to get out and away! If you weren't so
damned selfish, you'd let me go. I hate a selfish woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then it was that Jim Dodge, pressing closer to the long window,
heard her say quite distinctly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, father; we will go. Only I must go with you....
You are not strong enough to go alone. We will go anywhere you
like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew Bolton got nimbly out of his chair and stood glowering at
her across its back. Then he burst into a prolonged fit of laughter
mixed with coughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so you'll go with father, will you?&rdquo; he
spluttered. &ldquo;You insist&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, still coughing and laughing mirthlessly, he went out of the
room.</p>

<p>Left to herself, the girl sat down quietly enough before the fire.
Her serene face told no story of inward sorrow to the watchful eyes
of the man who loved her. Over long she had concealed her feelings,
even from herself. She seemed lost in revery, at once sad and
profound. Had she foreseen this dire disappointment of all her hopes,
he wondered.</p>

<p>He stole away at last, half ashamed of spying upon her lonely
vigil, yet withal curiously heartened. Wesley Elliot was right: Lydia
Orr needed a friend. He resolved that he would be that friend.</p>

<p>In the room overhead the light had leapt to full brilliancy. An
uncertain hand pulled the shade down crookedly. As the young man
turned for a last look at the house he perceived a shadow hurriedly
passing and repassing the lighted window. Then all at once the
shadow, curiously huddled, stooped and was gone. There was something
sinister in the sudden disappearance of that active shadow. Jim Dodge
watched the vacant window for a long minute; then with a muttered
exclamation walked on toward the village.</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XXVI</h4>

<p>In the barroom of the Brookville House the flaring kerosene lamp
lit up a group of men and half-grown boys, who had strayed in out of
the chill darkness to warm themselves around the great stove in the
middle of the floor. The wooden armchairs, which in summer made a
forum of the tavern's side piazza, had been brought in and ranged in
a wide semicircle about the stove, marking the formal opening of the
winter session. In the central chair sat the large figure of Judge
Fulsom, puffing clouds of smoke from a calabash pipe; his twinkling
eyes looking forth over his fat, creased cheeks roved impartially
about the circle of excited faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can understand all right about Andrew Bolton's turning
up,&rdquo; one man was saying. &ldquo;He was bound to turn up sooner
or later. I seen him myself, day before yesterday, going down street.
Thinks I, &lsquo;Who can that be?&rsquo;  There was something kind of
queer about the way he dragged his feet. What you going to do about
it, Judge? Have we got to put up with having a jailbird, as crazy as
a loon into the bargain, living right here in our midst?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In luxury and idleness, like he was a captain of
industry,&rdquo; drawled another man who was eating hot dog and
sipping beer. &ldquo;That's what strikes me kind of hard, Judge, in
luxury and idleness, while the rest of us has to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judge Fulsom gave an inarticulate grunt and smoked on
imperturbably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Set down, boys; set down,&rdquo; ordered a small man in a
red sweater under a corduroy coat. &ldquo;Give the Jedge a chance! He
ain't going to deliver no opinion whilst you boys are rammaging
around. Set down and let the Jedge take th' floor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A general scraping of chair legs and a shuffling of uneasy feet
followed this exhortation; still no word from the huge, impassive
figure in the central chair. The oily-faced young man behind the bar
improved the opportunity by washing a dozen or so glasses, setting
them down showily on a tin tray in view of the company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quit that noise, Cholley!&rdquo; exhorted the small man in
the red sweater; &ldquo;we want order in the court room&mdash;eh,
Jedge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I'd like to know is where she got all that money of
hers,&rdquo; piped an old man, with a mottled complexion and bleary
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure enough; where'd she get it?&rdquo; chimed in half a
dozen voices at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She's Andrew Bolton's daughter,&rdquo; said the first
speaker. &ldquo;And she's been setting up for a fine lady, doing
stunts for charity. How about our town hall an' our lov-elly library,
an' our be-utiful drinking fountain, and the new shingles on our
church roof? You don't want to ask too many questions,
Lute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't I?&rdquo; cried the man, who was eating hot dog.
&ldquo;You all know <em>me!</em>  I ain't a-going to stand for no
grab-game. If she's got money, it's more than likely the old fox
salted it down before they ketched him. It's our money; that's whose
money 'tis, if you want to know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he swallowed his mouthful with a slow, menacing glance which
swept the entire circle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Lucius,&rdquo; began Judge Fulsom, removing the pipe
from his mouth, &ldquo;go slow! No use in talk without
proof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what have you got to say, Jedge? Where'd she get all
that money she's been flamming about with, and that grand house,
better than new, with all the latest improvements. Wa'n't we some
jays to be took in like we was by a little, white-faced chit like
her? Couldn't see through a grindstone with a hole in it! Bolton
House.... And an automobile to fetch the old jailbird home in. Wa'n't
it love-ly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A low growl ran around the circle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Durn you, Lute! Don't you see the Jedge has something to
say?&rdquo; demanded the man behind the bar.</p>

<p>Judge Fulsom slowly tapped his pipe on the arm of his chair.
&ldquo;If you all will keep still a second and let me speak,&rdquo;
he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want my rights,&rdquo; interrupted a man with a hoarse
crow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your rights!&rdquo; shouted the Judge. &ldquo;You've got no
right to a damned thing but a good horsewhipping!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've got my rights to the money other folks are keeping,
I'll let you know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Judge fairly bellowed, as he got slowly to his feet:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you once for all, the whole damned lot of
you,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;that every man, woman and child in
Brookville has been paid, compensated, remunerated and requited in
full for every cent he, she or it lost in the Andrew Bolton bank
failure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a snarl of dissent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You all better go slow, and hold your tongues, and mind
your own business. Remember what I say; that girl does not owe a red
cent in this town, neither does her father. She's paid in full, and
you've spent a lot of it in here, too!&rdquo;  The Judge wiped his
red face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, Jedge; you don't want to be hard on the
house,&rdquo; protested the man in the red sweater, waving his arms
as frantically as a freight brakeman. &ldquo;Say, you boys! don't ye
git excited! The Jedge didn't mean that; you got him kind of het up
with argufying.... Down in front, boys! You, Lute&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was too late: half a dozen voices were shouting at once.
There was a simultaneous descent upon the bar, with loud demands for
liquor of the sort Lute Parsons filled up on. Then the raucous voice
of the ringleader pierced the tumult.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys! Let's go out to the old place and get our
rights off that gal of Bolton's!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's th' stuff, Lute!&rdquo; yelled the others, clashing
their glasses wildly. &ldquo;Come on! Come on, everybody!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In vain Judge Fulsom hammered on the bar and called for order in
the court room. The majesty of the law, as embodied in his great
bulk, appeared to have lost its power. Even his faithful henchman in
the red sweater had joined the rioters and was yelling wildly for his
rights. Somebody flung wide the door, and the barroom emptied itself
into the night, leaving the oily young man at his post of duty gazing
fearfully at the purple face of Judge Fulsom, who stood staring, as
if stupefied, at the overturned chairs, the broken glasses and the
empty darkness outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Jedge, them boys was sure some excited,&rdquo;
ventured the bartender timidly. &ldquo;You don't
s'pose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The big man put himself slowly into motion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll get th' constable,&rdquo; he growled.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I'll run 'em in; and I'll give Lute Parsons the full
extent of the law, if it's the last thing I do on earth. I&mdash;I'll
teach them!&mdash;I'll give them all they're lookin' for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he, too, went out, leaving the door swinging in the cold
wind.</p>

<p>At the corner, still meditating vengeance for this affront to his
dignity, Judge Fulsom almost collided with the hurrying figure of a
man approaching in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he challenged sharply. &ldquo;Where you goin'
so fast, my friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evening, Judge,&rdquo; responded the man, giving the other
a wide margin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it's Jim Dodge&mdash;eh? Say, Jim, did you meet any of
the boys on the road?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we got into a little discussion over to the Brookville
House about this Andrew Bolton business&mdash;his coming back
unexpected, you know; and some of the boys seemed to think they
hadn't got all that was coming to them by rights. Lute Parsons he
gets kind of worked up after about three or four glasses, and he
sicked the boys onto going out there, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going out&mdash;where? In the name of Heaven, what do you
mean, Judge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told 'em to keep cool and&mdash; Say, don't be in a
hurry, Jim. I had an awful good mind to call out Hank Simonson to run
a few of 'em in. But I dunno as the boys'll do any real harm. They
wouldn't dare. They know <em>me</em>, and they know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that drunken mob was headed for Bolton House?
Why, Good Lord, man, she's there practically alone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps you'd better see if you can get some
help,&rdquo; began the Judge, whose easy-going disposition was
already balking at effort.</p>

<p>But Jim Dodge, shouting back a few trenchant directions, had
already disappeared, running at top speed.</p>

<p>There was a short cut to Bolton House, across plowed fields and
through a patch of woodland. Jim Dodge ran all the way, wading a
brook, swollen with the recent rains, tearing his way through
thickets of brush and bramble, the twinkling lights in the top story
of the distant house leading him on. Once he paused for an instant,
thinking he heard the clamor of rude voices borne on the wind; then
plunged forward again, his flying feet seemingly weighted with lead;
and all the while an agonizing picture of Lydia, white and helpless,
facing the crowd of drunken men flitted before his eyes.</p>

<p>Now he had reached the wall at the rear of the gardens; had
clambered over it, dropping to his feet in the midst of a climbing
rose which clutched at him with its thorny branches; had run across
an acre of kitchen garden and leaped the low-growing hedge which
divided it from the sunken flower garden he had made for Lydia. Here
were more rosebushes and an interminable space broken by walks and a
sundial, masked by shrubs, with which he collided violently. There
was no mistaking the clamor from the front of the house; the rioters
had reached their quarry first! Not stopping to consider what one
man, single-handed and unarmed, could do against a score of drunken
opponents, the young man rounded the corner of the big house just as
the door was flung wide and the slim figure of Lydia stood outlined
against the bright interior.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want, men?&rdquo; she called out, in her clear,
fearless voice. &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a confused murmur of voices in reply. Most of the men
were decent enough fellows, when sober. Some one was heard to suggest
a retreat: &ldquo;No need to scare the young lady. 'Tain't her
fault!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw! shut up, you coward!&rdquo; shouted another. &ldquo;We
want our money!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get yer money?&rdquo; demanded a third.
&ldquo;You tell us that, young woman. That's what we're
after!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's the old thief? ...We want Andrew Bolton!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then from somewhere in the darkness a pebble flung by a reckless
hand shattered a pane of glass. At sound of the crash all pretense of
decency and order seemed abandoned. The spirit of the pack broke
loose!</p>

<p>Just what happened from the moment when he leaped upon the
portico, wrenching loose a piece of iron pipe which formed the
support of a giant wistaria, Jim Dodge could never afterward recall
in precise detail. A sort of wild rage seized him; he struck right
and left among the dark figures swarming up the steps. There were
cries, shouts, curses, flying stones; then he had dragged Lydia
inside and bolted the heavy door between them and the ugly clamor
without.</p>

<p>She faced him where he stood, breathing hard, his back against the
barred door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were saying&mdash;&rdquo; she whispered, her face
still and white. &ldquo;My God! What do they think I've
done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They're drunk,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It was only a
miserable rabble from the barroom in the village. But if you'd been
here alone&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I recognized the man who spoke first; his name is Parsons.
There were others, too, who worked on the place here in the
summer.... They have heard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded, unable to speak because of something which rose in his
throat choking him. Then he saw a thin trickle of red oozing from
under the fair hair above her temple, and the blood hammered in his
ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are hurt!&rdquo; he said thickly. &ldquo;The devils
struck you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's nothing&mdash;a stone, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something in the sorrowful look she gave him broke down the flimsy
barrier between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lydia&mdash;Lydia!&rdquo; he cried, holding out his
arms.</p>

<p>She clung to him like a child. They stood so for a moment,
listening to the sounds from without. There were still occasional
shouts and the altercation of loud, angry voices; but this was
momently growing fainter; presently it died away altogether.</p>

<p>She stirred in his arms and he stooped to look into her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;Father will be frightened,&rdquo; she murmured,
drawing away from him with a quick decided movement. &ldquo;You must
let me go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not until I have told you, Lydia! I am poor,
rough&mdash;not worthy to touch you&mdash;but I love you with my
whole heart and soul, Lydia. You must let me take care of you. You
need me, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tears overflowed her eyes, quiet, patient tears; but she answered
steadily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can't you see that I&mdash;I am different from other women?
I have only one thing to live for. I must go to him.... You had
forgotten&mdash;him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In vain he protested, arguing his case with all lover's skill and
ingenuity. She shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometime you will forgive me that one moment of
weakness,&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;I was frightened
and&mdash;tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He followed her upstairs in gloomy silence. The old man, she was
telling him hurriedly, would be terrified. She must reassure him; and
tomorrow they would go away together for a long journey. She could
see now that she had made a cruel mistake in bringing him to
Brookville.</p>

<p>But there was no answer in response to her repeated tapping at his
door; and suddenly the remembrance of that stooping shadow came back
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go in,&rdquo; he said, pushing her gently aside.</p>

<p>The lights, turned high in the quiet room, revealed only emptiness
and disorder; drawers and wardrobes pulled wide, scattered garments
apparently dropped at random on chairs and tables. The carpet, drawn
aside in one corner, disclosed a shallow aperture in the floor, from
which the boards had been lifted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash; What?&rdquo; stammered the girl, all the high
courage gone from her face. &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He picked up a box&mdash;a common cigar box&mdash;from amid the
litter of abandoned clothing. It was quite empty save for a solitary
slip of greenish paper which had somehow adhered to the bottom.</p>

<p>Lydia clutched the box in both trembling hands, staring with
piteous eyes at the damning evidence of that bit of paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;He must have hidden it
before&mdash;before&mdash; Oh, father, father!&rdquo;</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XXVII</h4>

<p>History is said to repeat itself, as if indeed the world were a
vast pendulum, swinging between events now inconceivably remote, and
again menacing and near. And if in things great and heroic, so also
in the less significant aspects of life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Henry Daggett stood, weary but triumphant, amid the nearly
completed preparations for a reception in the new church parlors, her
broad, rosy face wearing a smile of satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't it look nice?&rdquo; she said, by way of expressing
her overflowing contentment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maria Dodge, evergreen wreaths looped over one arm,
nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly does look fine, Abby,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;And I guess nobody but you would have thought of having
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett beamed. &ldquo;I thought of it the minute I heard
about that city church that done it. I call it a real tasty way to
treat a minister as nice as ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So 'tis,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Dodge with the air of
complacent satisfaction she had acquired since Fanny's marriage to
the minister. &ldquo;And I think Wesley'll appreciate it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daggett's face grew serious. Then her soft bosom heaved with
mirth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Tain't everybody that's lucky enough to have a minister
right in the family,&rdquo; said she briskly. &ldquo;Mebbe if I was
to hear a sermon preached every day in the week I'd get some piouser
myself. I've been comparing this with the fair we had last summer. It
ain't so grand, but it's newer. A fair's like a work of nature,
Maria; sun and rain and dew, and the scrapings from the henyard, all
mixed with garden ground to fetch out cabbages, potatoes or roses.
God gives the increase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dodge stared at her friend in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds real beautiful, Abby,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You must have thought it all out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's just what I done,&rdquo; confirmed Mrs. Daggett
happily. &ldquo;I'm always meditating about something, whilst I'm
working 'round th' house. And it's amazing what thoughts'll come to a
body from somewheres.... What you going to do with them wreaths,
Maria?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I was thinking of putting 'em right up here,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Dodge, pointing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good place,&rdquo; said Mrs. Daggett. &ldquo;Remember
Fanny peeking through them wreaths last summer? Pretty as a pink! An'
now she's Mis' Reveren' Elliot. I seen him looking at her that
night.... My! My! What lots of things have took place in our midst
since then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dodge, from the lofty elevation of a stepladder, looked
across the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes Ann Whittle with two baskets,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and Mrs. Solomon Black carrying a big cake, and a whole crowd
of ladies just behind 'em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad they ain't going to be late like they was last
year,&rdquo; said Mrs. Daggett. &ldquo;My sakes! I hadn't thought so
much about that fair till today; the scent of the evergreens brings
it all back. We was wondering who'd buy the things; remember,
Maria?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say I did,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Dodge, hopping
nimbly down from the ladder. &ldquo;There, that looks even nicer than
it did at the fair; don't you think so, Abby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks perfectly lovely, Maria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are at last,&rdquo; announced Mrs. Whittle as
she entered. &ldquo;I had to wait till the frosting stiffened up on
my cake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bustled over to a table and began to take the things out of
her baskets. Mrs. Daggett hurried forward to meet Mrs. Solomon Black,
who was advancing with slow majesty, bearing a huge disk covered with
tissue paper.</p>

<p>Mrs. Black was not the only woman in the town of Brookville who
could now boast sleeves made in the latest Parisian style. Her quick
black eyes had already observed the crisp blue taffeta, in which Mrs.
Whittle was attired, and the fresh muslin gowns decked with uncreased
ribbons worn by Mrs. Daggett and her friend, Maria Dodge. Mrs.
Solomon Black's water-waves were crisp and precise, as of yore, and
her hard red cheeks glowed like apples above the elaborate embroidery
of her dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Mis' Black, let me take your cake!&rdquo; offered
Abby Daggett. &ldquo;I sh'd think your arm would be most broke
carryin' it all the way from your house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Abby; but I wouldn't das' t' resk changin' it;
I'll set it right down where it's t' go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brisk chatter and laughter, which by now had prevaded the big
place, ceased as by a preconcerted signal, and a dozen women gathered
about the table toward which Mrs. Solomon Black was moving like the
central figure in some stately pageant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fer pity sake!&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Mixter, &ldquo;what d'
you s'pose she's got under all that tissue paper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Solomon Black set the great cake, still veiled, in the middle
of the table; then she straightened herself and looked from one to
the other of the eager, curious faces gathered around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I feel now 's 'o' I could
dror m' breath once more. I ain't joggled it once, so's t' hurt,
since I started from home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then slowly she withdrew the shrouding tissue paper from the
creation she had thus triumphantly borne to its place of honor, and
stood off, a little to one side, her face one broad smile of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fer goodness' sake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ev&mdash;er!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mis' Black!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain't that just&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never done that all yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Black nodded slowly, almost solemnly. The huge cake which was
built up in successive steps, like a pyramid, was crowned on its
topmost disk by a bridal scene, a tiny man holding his tiny veiled
bride by the hand in the midst of an expanse of pink frosting. About
the side of the great cake, in brightly colored &ldquo;mites,&rdquo;
was inscribed &ldquo;Greetings to our Pastor and his
Bride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought 'twould be kind of nice, seeing our minister was
just married, and so, in a way, this is a wedding reception. I don't
know what the rest of you ladies'll think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abby Daggett stood with clasped hands, her big soft bosom rising
and falling in a sort of ecstasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Phoebe,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it's a real poem! It
couldn't be no han'somer if it had been done right up in
heaven!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her arms about Mrs. Solomon Black and kissed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this ain't all,&rdquo; said Mrs. Black. &ldquo;Lois
Daggett is going to fetch over a chocolate cake and a batch of
crullers for me when she comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Applause greeted this statement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time was,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Black, &ldquo;and not so long
ago, neither, when I was afraid to spend a cent, for fear of a rainy
day that's been long coming. 'Tain't got here yet; but I can tell you
ladies, I got a lesson from <em>her</em> in generosity I don't mean
to forget. &lsquo;Spend and be spent&rsquo; is my motto from now on;
so I didn't grudge the new-laid eggs I put in that cake, nor yet the
sugar, spice nor raisins. There's three cakes in one&mdash;in token
of the trinity (I do hope th' won't nobody think it's wicked t'
mention r'ligion in connection with a cake); the bottom cake was
baked in a milk-pan, an' it's a bride's cake, being made with the
whites of fourteen perfec'ly fresh eggs; the next layer is fruit and
spice, as rich as wedding cake ought to be; the top cake is best of
all; and can be lifted right off and given to Rever'nd an' Mrs.
Wesley Elliot.... I guess they'll like to keep the wedding couple for
a souvenir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A vigorous clapping of hands burst forth. Mrs. Solomon Black
waited modestly till this gratifying demonstration had subsided, then
she went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess most of you ladies'll r'member how one short year
ago Miss Lyddy Orr Bolton came a'walkin' int' our midst, lookin'
sweet an' modest, like she was; and how down-in-th'-mouth we was all
a-feelin', 'count o' havin' no money t' buy th' things we'd worked s'
hard t' make. Some of us hadn't no more grit an' gumption 'n Ananias
an' S'phira, t' say nothin' o' Jonah an' others I c'd name. In she
came, an' ev'rythin' was changed from that minute! ...Now, I want we
sh'd cut up that cake&mdash;after everybody's had a chance t' see it
good&mdash;all but th' top layer, same's I said&mdash;an' all of us
have a piece, out o' compl'ment t' our paster an' his wife, an' in
memory o' her, who's gone from us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Lyddy Orr ain't dead, Mis' Black,&rdquo; protested Mrs.
Daggett warmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She might 's well be, 's fur 's our seein' her 's
concerned,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Black. &ldquo;She's gone t' Boston t'
stay f'r good, b'cause she couldn't stan' it no-how here in
Brookville, after her pa was found dead. The' was plenty o' hard
talk, b'fore an' after; an' when it come t' breakin' her windows with
stones an' hittin' her in th' head, so she was 'bleeged t' have three
stitches took, all I c'n say is I don't wonder she went t' Boston....
Anyway, that's my wish an' d'sire 'bout that cake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Wesley Elliot offered a welcome
interruption to a scene which was becoming uncomfortably tense.
Whatever prickings of conscience there might have been under the gay
muslin and silks of her little audience, each woman privately
resented the superior attitude assumed by Mrs. Solomon Black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy f'r <em>her</em> t' talk,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Fulsom,
from between puckered lips; &ldquo;<em>she</em> didn't lose no money
off Andrew Bolton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An' she didn't get none, neither, when it come t' dividin'
up,&rdquo; Mrs. Mixter reminded her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Fulsom, as she followed in
pretty Mrs. Mixter's wake to greet the newly-married pair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! ain't you proud o' her,&rdquo; whispered Abby Daggett
to Maria Dodge. &ldquo;She's a perfec' pictur' o' joy, if ever I laid
my eyes on one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny stood beside her tall husband, her pretty face irradiating
happiness. She felt a sincere pity welling up in her heart for Ellen
Dix and Joyce Fulsom and the other girls. Compared with her own
transcendent experiences, their lives seemed cold and bleak to Fanny.
And all the while she was talking to the women who crowded about
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; we are getting nicely settled, thank you, Mrs.
Fulsom&mdash;all but the attic. Oh, how'd you do, Judge
Fulsom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The big man wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just been fetchin' in th' ice cream freezers,&rdquo; he
said, with his booming chuckle. &ldquo;I guess I'm 's well 's c'n be
expected, under th' circumstances, ma'am.... An' that r'minds me,
parson, a little matter was s'ggested t' me. In fact, I'd thought of
it, some time ago. No more 'n right, in view o' th' facts. If you
don't mind, I'll outline th' idee t' you, parson, an' see if you
approve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny, striving to focus attention on the pointed remarks Miss
Lois Daggett was making, caught occasional snatches of their
conversation. Fanny had never liked Lois Daggett; but in her new
r&ocirc;le of minister's wife, it was her foreordained duty to love
everybody and to condole and sympathize with the parish at large. One
could easily sympathize with Lois Daggett, she was thinking; what
would it be like to be obliged daily to face the reflection of that
mottled complexion, that long, pointed nose, with its rasped tip,
that drab lifeless hair with its sharp hairpin crimp, and those small
greenish eyes with no perceptible fringe of lashes? Fanny looked down
from her lovely height into Miss Daggett's upturned face and pitied
her from the bottom of her heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear your brother Jim has gone t' Boston,&rdquo; Miss
Daggett was saying with a simper.</p>

<p>From the rear Fanny heard Judge Fulsom's rumbling monotone,
earnestly addressed to her husband:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that Boston ain't a nice town t' live in; but we'll
have t' enter a demurrer against her staying there f'r good. Y'
see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fanny, smiling at Miss Daggett. &ldquo;He
went several days ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H'm-m,&rdquo; murmured Miss Daggett. &ldquo;<em>She's</em>
livin' there, ain't she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean Miss Orr?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean Miss Lyddy Bolton. I guess Bolton's a good 'nough
name for <em>her</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the Judge, in a somewhat louder tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's th' way it looks t' me, dominie; an' if all th'
leadin' citizens of Brookville'll put their name to it&mdash;an' I'm
of th' opinion they will, when I make my charge t' th'
jury&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; murmured Fanny absently, as she gazed at
her husband and the judge.</p>

<p>She couldn't help wondering why her Wesley was speaking so
earnestly to the Judge, yet in such a provokingly low tone of
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had become so accustomed to thinking of her as Lydia
Orr,&rdquo; she finished hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don't b'lieve in givin' out a name 'at ain't
yourn,&rdquo; said Lois Daggett, sharply. &ldquo;She'd ought t' 'a'
told right out who she was, an' what she come t' Brookville
<em>for</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judge Fulsom and the minister had moved still further away. Fanny,
with some alarm, felt herself alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think Miss Orr meant to be deceitful,&rdquo; she
said nervously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, o' course, if she's a-goin' t' be in th' family, it's
natural you sh'd think so,&rdquo; said Lois Daggett, sniffing
loudly.</p>

<p>Fanny did not answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sh'd <em>hope</em> she an' Jim was engaged,&rdquo;
proclaimed Miss Daggett. &ldquo;If they ain't, they'd ought t'
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should you say that, Miss Lois?&rdquo; asked Fanny
hurriedly. &ldquo;They are very good friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Daggett bent forward, lowering her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The's one thing I'd like t' know f'r certain,&rdquo; she
said: &ldquo;Did Jim Dodge find that body?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny stared at her inquisitor resentfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were a good many persons searching,&rdquo; she said
coldly.</p>

<p>Miss Daggett wagged her head in an irritated fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I know <em>that</em>,&rdquo; she snapped.
&ldquo;What I want t' know is whether Jim Dodge&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never asked my brother,&rdquo; interrupted Fanny.
&ldquo;It all happened so long ago, why not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not s' terrible long,&rdquo; disagreed Miss Daggett.
&ldquo;It was th' first o' November. N' I've got a mighty good reason
f'r askin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have?&rdquo; murmured Fanny, flashing a glance of
entreaty at her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of us ladies was talkin' it over,&rdquo; pursued the
spinster relentlessly, &ldquo;an' I says t' Mis' Deacon Whittle:
&lsquo;Who counted th' money 'at was found on Andrew Bolton's
body?&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;W'y,&rsquo; s' she, &lsquo;th' ones 'at
found him out in th' woods where he got lost, I s'pose.&rsquo;  But
come t' sift it right down t' facts, not one o' them ladies c'd tell
f'r certain who 't was 'at found that body. The' was such an'
excitement 'n' hullaballoo, nobody 'd thought t' ask. It wa'n't
Deacon Whittle; n'r it wa'n't th' party from th' Brookville House;
ner Hank Simonson, ner any o' the boys. <em>It was Jim Dodge, an' she
was with him!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Fanny faintly.</p>

<p>She looked up to meet the minister's eyes, with a sense of strong
relief. Wesley was so wise and good. Wesley would know just what to
say to this prying woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you and Miss Daggett talking about so
earnestly?&rdquo; asked the minister.</p>

<p>When informed of the question under discussion, he frowned
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Daggett,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you will
fetch me the dinner bell from Mrs. Whittle's kitchen, I shall be
happy to answer your question and others like it which have reached
me from time to time concerning this unhappy affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mis' Deacon Whittle's dinner bell?&rdquo; gasped Lois
Daggett. &ldquo;What's that got t' do with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring it to me, and you'll see,&rdquo; smiled the minister
imperturbably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, Wesley?&rdquo; whispered
Fanny.</p>

<p>He gazed gravely down into her lovely eyes.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo;</em> he whispered back, &ldquo;trust
me! It is time we laid this uneasy ghost; don't you think
so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>By now the large room was well filled with men, women and
children. The ice cream was being passed around when suddenly the
clanging sound of a dinner bell, vigorously operated by Joe Whittle,
arrested attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The minister's got something to say! The minister's got
something to say!&rdquo; shouted the boy.</p>

<p>Wesley Elliot, standing apart, lifted his hand in token of
silence, then he spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have taken this somewhat unusual method of asking your
attention to a matter which has for many years past enlisted your
sympathies,&rdquo; he began: &ldquo;I refer to the Bolton
affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sound of breath sharply indrawn and the stir of many feet died
into profound silence as the minister went on, slowly and with
frequent pauses:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of you are already familiar with the sordid details.
It is not necessary for me to go back to the day, now nearly nineteen
years ago, when many of you found yourselves unexpectedly
impoverished because the man you trusted had defaulted.... There was
much suffering in Brookville that winter, and since.... When I came
to this parish I found it&mdash;sick. Because of the crime of Andrew
Bolton? No. I repeat the word with emphasis: <em>No!</em>  Brookville
was sick, despondent, dull, gloomy and impoverished&mdash;not because
of Andrew Bolton's crime; but because Brookville had never forgiven
Andrew Bolton.... Hate is the one destructive element in the
universe; did you know that, friends? It is impossible for a man or
woman who hates another to prosper.... And I'll tell you why this
is&mdash;why it must be true: God is love&mdash;the opposite of hate.
Hence All Power is enlisted on the side of <em>love</em>.... Think
this over, and you'll know it is true.... Now the Bolton mystery: A
year ago we were holding a fair in this village, which was sick and
impoverished because it had never forgiven the man who stole its
money.... You all remember that occasion. There were things to sell;
but nobody had money to buy them. It wasn't a pleasant occasion.
Nobody was enjoying it, least of all your minister. But a miracle
took place&mdash; There are miracles in the world today, as there
always have been, thank God! There came into Brookville that day a
person who was moved by love. Every impulse of her heart; everything
she did was inspired by that mightiest force of the universe. She
called herself Lydia Orr.... She had been called Lydia Orr, as far
back as she could remember; so she did no wrong to anyone by
retaining that name. But she had another name, which she quickly
found was a byword and a hissing in Brookville. Was it strange that
she shrank from telling it? She believed in the forgiveness of sins;
and she had come to right a great wrong.... She did what she could,
as it is written of another woman, who poured out a fragrant offering
of love unappreciated save by One.... There quickly followed the last
chapter in the tragedy&mdash;for it was all a tragedy, friends, as I
look at it: the theft; the pitiful attempt to restore fourfold all
that had been taken; the return of that ruined man, Andrew Bolton,
after his heavy punishment; and his tragic death.... Some of you may
not know all that happened that night. You do know of the cowardly
attack made upon the helpless girl. You know of the flight of the
terrified man, of how he was found dead two days later three miles
from the village, in a lonely spot where he had perished from hunger
and exposure.... The body was discovered by James Dodge, with the aid
of his dog. With him on that occasion was a detective from Boston,
employed by Miss Bolton, and myself. There was a sum of money found
on the body amounting to something over five thousand dollars. It had
been secreted beneath the floor of Andrew Bolton's chamber, before
his arrest and imprisonment. It is probable that he intended to make
good his escape, but failed, owing to the illness of his wife....
This is a terrible story, friends, and it has a sad ending.
Brookville had never learned to forgive. It had long ago formed the
terrible habits of hate: suspicion, envy, sharp-tongued censure and
the rest. Lydia Bolton could not remain here, though it was her
birthplace and her home.... She longed for friendship! She asked for
bread and you gave her&mdash;a stone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The profound silence was broken by a sob from a distant corner.
The strained listeners turned with a sharp movement of relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fer pity sake!&rdquo; faltered Abby Daggett, her beautiful,
rosy face all quivering with grief. &ldquo;Can't nobody do
nothing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am!&rdquo; shouted the big voice of Judge Fulsom.
&ldquo;We can all do something.... I ain't going to sum up the case
against Brookville; the parson's done it already; if there's any
rebuttal coming from the defendant, now's the time to bring it before
the court.... Nothing to say&mdash;eh? Well, I thought so! We're
guilty of the charges preferred, and I'm going to pass sentence....
But before I do that, there's one thing the parson didn't mention,
that in my opinion should be told, to wit: Miss Lydia Bolton's
money&mdash;all that she had&mdash;came to her from her uncle, an
honest hardworkin' citizen of Boston. He made every penny of it as a
soap-boiler. So you see 'twas <em>clean</em> money; and he left it to
his niece, Lydia Bolton. What did she do with it? You know! She
poured it out, right here in Brookville&mdash;pretty nigh all there
was of it. She's got her place here; but mighty little besides. I'm
her trustee, and I know. The five thousand dollars found on the dead
body of Andrew Bolton, has been made a trust fund for the poor and
discouraged of this community, under conditions anybody that'll take
the trouble to step in to my office can find out....&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Judge paused to clear his throat, while he produced from his
pocket, with a vast deal of ceremony, a legal looking document
dangling lengths of red ribbon and sealing wax.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This Bond of Indemnity, which I'm going to ask every man,
woman and child of fifteen years and up'ards, of the village of
Brookville, hereinafter known as the Party of the First Part, to
sign, reads as follows: Know all men by these presents that we,
citizens of the village of Brookville, hereinafter known as the Party
of the First Part, are held and firmly bound unto Miss Lydia Orr
Bolton, hereinafter known as the Party of the Second Part....
Whereas; the above-named Party of the Second Part (don't f'rget that
means Miss Lydia Bolton) did in behalf of her father&mdash;one Andrew
Bolton, deceased&mdash;pay, compensate, satisfy, restore, remunerate,
recompense <em>and re-quite</em> all legal indebtedness incurred by
said Andrew Bolton to, for, and in behalf of the aforesaid Party of
the First Part....</p>

<p>&ldquo;You git me? If you don't, just come to my office and I'll
explain in detail any of the legal terms not understood, comprehended
and known by the feeble-minded of Brookville. Form in line at nine
o'clock. First come, first served:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We, the Party of the First Part, bind ourselves, and each
of our heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, jointly and
severally, firmly by these presents, and at all times hereafter to
save, defend, keep harmless and indemnify the aforesaid Party of the
Second Part (Miss Lydia Bolton) of, from and against all further
costs, damages, expense, disparagements (that means spiteful gossip,
ladies!) molestations, slander, vituperations, etc. (I could say
more, <em>but</em> we've got something to do that'll take time.)  And
whereas, the said Party of the Second Part has been actually drove to
Boston to live by the aforesaid slander, calumniations, aspersions
and libels&mdash;which we, the said Party of the First Part do hereby
acknowledge to be false and untrue (yes, and doggone mean, as I look
at it)&mdash;we, the said Party of the First part do firmly bind
ourselves, our heirs, executors, administrators an' assigns to quit
all such illegalities from this day forth, and forever more.&rdquo;
...</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to get out of the habit of talking mean about
Andrew Bolton, for one thing. It's been as catching as measles in
this town since I can remember. Andrew Bolton's dead and buried in
our cemetery, beside his wife. We'll be there ourselves, some day; in
the meanwhile we want to reform our tongues. You get me? All
right!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And whereas, we, the Party of the First Part, otherwise
known as the village of Brookville, do ask, beg, entreat, supplicate
and plead the f'rgiveness of the Party of the Second Part, otherwise
known as Miss Lydia Orr Bolton. And we also hereby request, petition,
implore <em>an'</em> importune Miss Lydia Orr Bolton, otherwise known
as the Party of the Second Part, to return to Brookville and make it
her permanent place of residence, promising on our part, at all times
hereafter, to save, defend, keep harmless and indemnify her against
all unfriendliness, of whatever sort; and pledging ourselves to be
good neighbors and loving friends from the date of this document,
which, when signed by th' Party of the First Part, shall be of full
force and virtue. Sealed with our seals. Dated this seventh day of
June, in the year of our Lord, nineteen hundred&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A loud uproar of applause broke loose in the pause that followed;
then the minister's clear voice called for silence once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Judge has his big fountain pen filled to its
capacity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come forward and sign this&mdash;the
most remarkable document on record, I am not afraid to say. Its
signing will mean the wiping out of an old bitterness and the dawning
of a new and better day for Brookville!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Reverend Wesley Elliot had mixed his metaphors sadly; but no
one minded that, least of all the minister himself, as he signed his
name in bold black characters to the wondrous screed, over which
Judge Fulsom had literally as well as metaphorically burned the
midnight oil. Deacon and Mrs. Whittle signed; Postmaster and Mrs.
Daggett signed, the latter with copious tears flowing over her smooth
rosy cheeks. Miss Lois Daggett was next:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I ought to be written down near the front,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;seeing I'm full as much to blame, and like that, as
most anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on you, Lute Parsons!&rdquo; roared the Judge, while a
group of matrons meekly subscribed their signatures. &ldquo;We want
some live men-folks on this document.... Aw, never mind, if you did!
We all know you wa'n't yourself that night, Lucius.... That's right;
come right forward! We want the signature of every man that went out
there that night, full of cussedness and bad whiskey.... That's the
ticket! Come on, everybody! Get busy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody had attended the door for the last hour, Joe Whittle being
a spellbound witness of the proceedings; and so it chanced that
nobody saw two persons, a man and a woman who entered
quietly&mdash;one might almost have said timidly, as if doubtful of a
welcome in the crowded place. It was Abby Daggett who caught sight of
the girl's face, shining against the soft dark of the summer night
like a pale star.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my sakes alive!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;if there
ain't Lyddy Bolton and Jim Dodge, now! Did you ever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she folded the girl's slight figure to her capacious breast,
Mrs. Daggett summed up in a single pithy sentence all the legal
phraseology of the Document, which by now had been signed by
everybody old enough to write their names:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! we certainly are glad you've come home, Lyddy; an' we
hope you'll never leave us no more!&rdquo;</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XXVIII</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; said Ellen suddenly; &ldquo;I want to tell
you something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wesley Elliot turned a complacently abstracted gaze upon her
friend who sat beside her on the vine-shaded piazza of the parsonage.
She felt the sweetest sympathy for Ellen, whenever she thought of her
at all:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember my speaking to you about Jim&mdash; Oh, a
long time ago, and how he&mdash;? It was perfectly ridiculous, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny's blue eyes became suddenly alert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the time Jim kissed you,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;Oh, Ellen, I've always been so sorry for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; you needn't be,&rdquo; interrupted Ellen; &ldquo;I
never cared a snap for Jim Dodge; so there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youthful matron sighed gently: she felt that she understood
poor dear Ellen perfectly, and in token thereof she patted poor dear
Ellen's hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know exactly how you feel,&rdquo; she warbled.</p>

<p>Ellen burst into a gleeful laugh:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think you do; but you don't,&rdquo; she informed her
friend, with a spice of malice. &ldquo;Your case was entirely
different from mine, my dear: You were perfectly crazy over Wesley
Elliot; I was only in love with being in love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny looked sweetly mystified and a trifle piqued withal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to have a romance&mdash;to be madly in
love,&rdquo; Ellen explained. &ldquo;Oh, you know! Jim was merely a
peg to hang it on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wife of the minister smiled a lofty compassion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything seems so different after one is married,&rdquo;
she stated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that really so?&rdquo; cried Ellen. &ldquo;Well, I shall
soon know, Fan, for I'm to be married in the fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Married? Why, Ellen Dix!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh&mdash;huh,&rdquo; confirmed Ellen, quite satisfied with
the success of her <i>coup</i>. &ldquo;You don't know him, Fan; but
he's perfectly elegant&mdash;and <em>handsome!</em>  Just wait till
you see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen rocked herself to and fro excitedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I met him in Grenoble last winter, and we're going to live
there in the <em>sweetest</em> house. He fell in love with me the
first minute he saw me. You never knew anyone to be so awfully in
love ... m'm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without in the least comprehending the reason for the phenomenon,
Mrs. Wesley Elliot experienced a singular depression of spirit. Of
course she was glad poor dear Ellen was to be happy. She strove to
infuse a sprightly satisfaction into her tone and manner as she
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What wonderful news, dear. But isn't it
rather&mdash;sudden? I mean, oughtn't you to have known him longer!
...You didn't tell me his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ellen's piquant dark face sparkled with mischief and
happiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name is Harvey Wade,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;you
know Wade and Hampton, where you bought your wedding things, Fan?
Everybody knows the Wades, and I've known Harvey long enough
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She grew suddenly wistful as she eyed her friend:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>have</em> changed a lot since you were married,
Fan; all the girls think so. Sometimes I feel almost afraid of you.
Is it&mdash;do you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fanny's unaccountable resentment melted before a sudden rush of
sympathy and understanding. She drew Ellen's blushing face close to
her own in the sweetness of caresses:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm <em>so</em> glad for you, dear, so
<em>glad!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you'll tell Jim?&rdquo; begged Ellen, after a silence
full of thrills. &ldquo;I should hate to have him
suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He doesn't, Ellen,&rdquo; Jim's sister assured her, out of
a secret fund of knowledge to which she would never have confessed.
&ldquo;Jim always understood you far better than I did. And he likes
you, too, better than any girl in Brookville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except Lydia,&rdquo; amended Ellen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, except Lydia.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 align="center">Chapter XXIX</h4>

<p>There was a warm, flower-scented breeze stirring the heavy foliage
drenched with the silver rain of moonlight, and the shrilling of
innumerable small voices of the night. It all belonged; yet neither
the man nor the woman noticed anything except each other; nor heard
anything save the words the other uttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think that you love me, Lydia!&rdquo; he said, triumph
and humility curiously mingled in his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could I help it, Jim? I could never have borne it all,
if you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Lydia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked down into her face which the moonlight had spiritualized
to the likeness of an angel.</p>

<p>She smiled and slipped her hand into his.</p>

<p>They were alone in the universe, so he stooped and kissed her,
murmuring inarticulate words of rapture.</p>

<p>After uncounted minutes they walked slowly on, she within the
circle of his arm, her blond head against the shoulder of his rough
tweed coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When shall it be, Lydia?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>She blushed&mdash;even in the moonlight he could see the adorable
flutter of color in her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am all alone in the world, Jim,&rdquo; she said, rather
sadly. &ldquo;I have no one but you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll love you enough to make up for forty relations!&rdquo;
he declared. &ldquo;And, anyway, as soon as we're married you'll have
mother and Fan and&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made a wry face, as it occurred to him for the first time that
the Reverend Wesley Elliot was about to become Lydia's
brother-in-law.</p>

<p>The girl laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven't you learned to like him yet?&rdquo; she inquired
teasingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can stand him for a whole hour at a time now, without
experiencing a desire to kick him,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;But why
should we waste time talking about Wesley Elliot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lydia appeared to be considering his question with some
seriousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Jim,&rdquo; she said, looking straight up into his
eyes with the innocent candor he had loved in her from the beginning,
&ldquo;Mr. Elliot will expect to marry us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's so!&rdquo; conceded Jim; &ldquo;Fan will expect it,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her eagerly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren't you in a hurry for that wonderful brother-in-law,
Lydia? Don't you think&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The smile on her face was wonderful now; he felt curiously abashed
by it, like one who has inadvertently jested in a holy place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, dearest,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you would like&mdash;if it is not too soon&mdash;my
birthday is next Saturday. Mother used to make me a little party on
my birthday, so I thought&mdash;it seemed to me&mdash;and the roses
are all in bloom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was only one way to thank her for this halting little
speech: he took her in his arms and whispered words which no one, not
even the crickets in the hedge could hear, if crickets ever were
listeners, and not the sole chorus on their tiny stage of life.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
